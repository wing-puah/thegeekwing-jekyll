      <h3>I love stories</h3>
      <p>
      Upon graduation, I set off for a 6 months working holiday in New Zealand, in hope to find the meaning of life. Being young and hopeful, I want to find out how I could make the world a better place. After almost a decade of experience from working in the zoo, performing as a belly dancer, working as soft-skills trainer and sports coach, to a start-up founder, I discover that what I want to do is to be involved in the tech industry. Hence,the journey towards becoming a self-taught developer begin.

      <p>
      Within 2 year of setting my goals, I landed my first paying web-development client, helped non-profits to establish their event websites, spoke at a few places and got a job in a blockchain company.
