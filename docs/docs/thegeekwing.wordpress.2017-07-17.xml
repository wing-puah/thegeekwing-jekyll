		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We would dance to the sunflower sway,
and the reflection of the lake
by the music thumping in our chest.

The sun could tease us for all it's worth.
I'm going to hold you tight,
let your breathe around my neck.

The butterflies envy our naked bodies
whenever we flit to the rhythm of the wind
across the field.

That could be just the day but it isn't anymore,
because you rather her in your arms.
And I dance for you no more.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The truth about dream chasers</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/the-truth-about-dreamchasers/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">This is to the one who chases dreams.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is to the ones who is different. This is to the ones who has been ridiculed by others for following “stupid” dreams.  This is to the one who believes in justice. This is to the one who is being chided for indulging in life’s fantasy.</p>
<strong>This is to the one who is human and knows how a heart beats feel.</strong>

You are one but you are not alone in this world. You are not the only one to cry yourself to sleep when you remember how far away your dream is. You are not the only one to scream that nobody understands you. You are not the only one to feel confuse, we all do sometimes, it’s as if everyone wants us to believe that there is no value in protecting our dreams. But if you know your life’s purpose, you have to go down the path that is shown to you.
<h2>Even if the whole world seems to be boycotting you, you got to remain true to who you are.</h2>
Because you are on a sacred journey and you are not alone. We might not be in your immediate social circle, but we are here, we, your fellow dream chasers, exist.

<strong>We know how it is like</strong>.

We have moments of ecstasy and periods of wrought. We think that we have the best kind of life one moment but start to consider how comfortable life would be in the <i>normal</i> lane. If we perserve, we might emerge wise. But before that, most of the time, we are struggling to stay afloat, tear between decisions to pursue our dreams and to pay the bills. If we’re lucky, maybe we get to actually figure out what exactly is going on in our lifetime.

But even if that doesn’t happen, we’ll keep doing what we believe in.

I couldn’t guarantee you that if you practice for hours daily, you would be able to fulfill your dreams. I couldn’t promise you that everything would work out if you hang on long enough. A lot of self-help books ensure you that there is abundance in our universe and that you would attract it into your life if you do it right. This looks good on paper and sounds like a promising best seller. But do you not notice that there seems to be more and more personal development books on the rack? If people are being helped by the book, why are there still people buying these self-help book, pushing new titles up the best sellers? I do not want to feed you with delusions yet I do not hope to tarnish your dreams. But the truth is, there is no abundance in the world but competition. And only the best would get to enjoy the pie.

But does this matter to you? Does having a truckload of money seem more important than immersing in life? Would a day job prevent you from working towards your dream? Would you rather spend your free time watching TV than practicing? Would you look at the best and think that there is no really place for you, even if you could be the second best? If your answer is yes, then so be it. Drop your dreams and never look back. Don’t look back and regret the decisions that you made. Because you are the one who did not want to put in the effort in the first place.

But if your answer is no, then run fast. Run for your dreams fast because there are millions out there who are starting to chase after you.
<h2>And because, only the best would get the pie.</h2>
<strong>Run, and don’t look back too. </strong>

You have a long magical journey for you to experience. Run and immerse yourself in the experience. Feel every bit of sweat, breath, pain and triumph. Feel the sparks that keep your heart beating. If you trip, you have two choices to make. One is to remain on the floor while looking at the others run pass you and the other, is to climb back up. Maybe you’ll be limping initially, and maybe you would fall again. But this is just part of the process. You’ll get stronger and you’ll start running again. If you do see other people fall, maybe you’ll be kind enough to give them a hand. Then maybe they would run beside you and support you. You’ll see that you are not alone.

<strong>The world is not a battleground though it is not quite a playground.</strong>

Maybe we’ll never figure out what the world really is, seemingly malicious for day and loving for the next. But this is just the way things are, this are the things that we couldn’t control. But what we could control is how we are going to react to whatever the world throws at us, the next step is ours to make.

Maybe you’ll never make it to your dream and maybe you’ll end up in poverty. Maybe your dream becomes a reality and maybe you would become great. I’m not a fortune teller and I can’t tell you in exact how things would go. In the face of such ambiguity, would you choose to keep chasing your dream?
<h2>Would you keep your heart beating?</h2>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The simple prayer from me, a nobody</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">I hold my hands, and pray.
For eternity, i pray not.
For great fortune, i pray not.
For transcending, i pray not.</p>
I hold my hands, silently imagining that I could feel your warmth.
or perhaps I did feel your presence a little real.
I pray and you stay
to hear what i have to say.

I pray, for the wealth of the earth,
the abundance of the sea,
the steadfastness of a dog,
the affection of a pig,
the playfulness of a dolphin,
the strength of an eagle,
the serenity of a whale and
the rapport of a wolf.

Then, you come close to me, your hands atop of mine.
For all I pray is true, and would stay,
but only if human awakes to compassion each day.

They all say they be faithful servants but they don't do pass the label.
They deny and desecrate god, in order to live in their ways of gluttony.
He preaches that all is the creation of the Supreme
and all is one and equal.
But yet, they believe on their dominance over all creatures,
they concur, because it sounds ego-fulfilling.
Sexuality, gender, races, religions, and species differences
all make a sound reason for their violent acts.

Because the others don't follow in the one true path,
towards the love of god, so the others should be punished.
So they torture the other beings,
especially those who look remotely from the "higher" human beings.

All is one and equal is just a fallacy.
They crave for connection with the Supreme
yet feast and indulge in the carcasses of beings,
who are too created with love and dedication from
the same hand they profess to love.

And they, with their chest cock and belly full, surely
would tell you that this is not blasphemy, but a God's gift.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Just Another Post About Life Purpose. Or Is It?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever feel like life overwhelm you? Have you ever feel like you just need to stop doing whatever you profess to love and let your life pans out freely? I did.

I'm the kind of person that believes I have to try things to know if I like it or not. So there you go, I try diving, chinese painting, laughing yoga, guitar playing, photography, inline-skating, sky-diving, backpacking, cycling, jogging, learning a new language. Some of them I'm still doing it, but most that are listed over here, I have to drop them. Because there are only so much time that one could use in the world. Over the years, I learn to differentiate things I feel curious about from things I really have a passion for.
<h2><strong>Sometimes I lose my way. </strong></h2>
<strong>Alright, I'm still not figuring out my direction yet. My life is still a big mystery to me.</strong>

I have thought that I always knew what I wanted. But life keeps changing. Today, I realise that I have forgotten about what I set my mind to. I have forgotten about the fact that I want the world to hear the helpless and voiceless.

I have been diminished to a miserable lady who could only complain about the misgivings and misdeeds of the world: greedy corporations, poverty, income inequality, animal abuse, factory farming, monoculture, global warming, overfishing, increase landfill. They make me a prison of my mind whenever they pop up. Reality scorns at me, telling me that I'm just a hypocritical person who preaches and never progress with my practices.
<h2><strong>I am constantly flirting with guilt.</strong></h2>
I feel guilty that I'm not working towards reducing waste. I feel guilty because I get frustrated talking to my parents. (Somehow people closest to me makes me on my nerves most) I feel guilty that I'm indulging when people are living in broken lives. Even if it's just ten percent of my meagre pay, I could help a lot of people in the third world countries, but I'm not doing it. I could stand to my defense that I really have no savings (this is true) and I spend all my money planning for the next course to take. There are just too many things that I could list out that would be beneficial to my life: permaculture, tribal fusion belly dance, the next yoga retreat, a writer's course.
<h2><strong>But I am only human, too human in fact.</strong></h2>
I'm just a girl who wallow in my own form of depression when a guy decides to ditch me, or to treat me like trash. I'm just someone who wants to indulge in the dandy sweet treats. I'm just a person who seeks comfort in life.

I want to do what I love, I want to follow my dreams, I want to dance, to do yoga, to cook and serve delicious vegan food, I want to own a farm and start my natural farming experiment.

I<strong> decide that I'm not going to feel bad about myself and go about beating myself for not doing enough.</strong>

I feel grateful for my life, for all the gifts and for the ability to rise with the sun. Today, just for today.

You know, life is not a race to be competed with others, it is more of a walking your own path as you are. But I feel I'm back on track, at least for the moment. My life has taken a new turn, or rather a clearer path. At the risk of sounding egoistic, I want to contribute to the society and the environment. I say it even though I do not know how I'm going to do it and what I'm going to do. I'm leaving my choice open and hoping I could receive my answers in due time.

Till then, I continue with my simple life towards sustainability. My life is not about finding out my life purpose anymore. How long would I have to wait before I could get our answers? And how would I know if the answers are right?
<h2>Life is really about loving and caring.</h2>
<strong>And that is what keeps me right on the path that reveals itself a little more with each day worth living.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I love this post. So much here that I could relate to.
I used to live in the guilt paradigm a lot. But really, who's to say what is meaningful in life?
It hurt me so much that there was so much suffering going on in the world. I really wanted to do something about it all. Many, like the things you listed in your post.
There are people who's work visibly involves doing things about the huge issues stated. I have great respect for their work. But what could I do? I used to beat myself up for wanting to do things that didn't seem directly connected to making the world a better place. Judging and abusing myself seemed okay because it was targeted at me, not anybody else. But no matter who it is targeted against, that spiteful feeling inside me is in essence the same emotion that causes visible hurt in the world when targeted at others.
Now I think if there is anything I can do in the world, I can only be myself. And be at peace with just being me. And if I live that way each day, doing what I can, one day I may find what I do in life visibly acting against the huge issues today. Who knows what that work will be?

Sorry for the long comment, I was so happy to read this post as I could relate to so much of it.
I love your blog by the way, Good luck with everything :)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello purehozho1, don't worry about leaving long comments on my blog, I love to hear from people :D I think one thing my ex-boss have to tolerate is that sometimes I would put my work aside to make long conversation with customers. It is really fun and I get to learn new things on the way. I believe so long as we have the right intentions in our actions, as long as we don't harm unnecessarily, we are on the right way. Then again I could be wrong XP I'm also just practicing being at peace with myself, and maybe one day, who knows what will come. Even if I achieve nothing great, I would still be great to say that in my lifetime, I have loved myself and lived to be who I am (haha, I'm really proud to say that because I think that nowadays not too many people could say that with dignity and faith! not in my country anyway. hahah.) But really, what do I know? Oh well, maybe we are all just lost sheeps. but still, I'm going to have fun while I can. Thank you for your comment :D 

All the best to you :D]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Muddling and trudging, this spot once more. Sinking deep
my waist, and soon perhaps up my neck. Then maybe, I’ll
drown for real this time round. Liberated, it might be.
Again, I swear, one after another, that I have enough.
Can’t they tell that I have enough?

But he makes me think otherwise. That he is
the one I seek, for a long time too.
Can’t learn pretty from the previous that
in no good it would end? Ending it would be,
like those ones, the previous one, and the one before the previous one,
and they all go like so.

<strong>Let it end here now. No good it would end.</strong>

Could he be the one?
I could tell that I love him so, but could it
all be hearsay not? This and that, I move on quick.
Separation is not what I dwell upon. Go far away for him,
I know he would, for they all do, like grown-ups sick of their childhood teddy
bear. No longer cuddly and nice but old, foul and lame.
Why don’t he tell me what I need to hear, just something
barely
so simple to make me his.

<strong>Stay. Just stay.</strong>

A why for I couldn’t ask you why. The questions in my mind.
Could I hug you and cry and tell you
that I didn’t want you to be like them so.
That maybe I change, from my apathy and lack of display
of affections to flourishing and nurturing,
so fully hearted, so surely it would be.
We’ll be a cute little couple, despite our age.
Dreaming into the stars and hovering along the fields.

But of course you can't.
You have to go, you need to fly,
and maybe settle somewhere nice,
a very so cliché that I’m sick of hearing .
Nobody has stop you, and this just isn’t the place for you.
To be honest, neither is this the place for me. Maybe so,
we don’t really have a place, except for the moment now.

<strong>Stay, pray, please, don’t go. I cry but like a stone deep in the sea.</strong>

Why would you be bothered with me now? You didn’t, never did
and dear, no, you don’t have to.
I would write a love poem about you,
letting it rhyme along the days we skipping left.
All our dreams build on, day after day,
nearer and closer, perhaps till we collide
and entwine.
Day after day would turn into year after year,
then a lifetime of yours and mine, us for all its' finite.
What naivety of the young. You’ve seen too much and know better, didn’t you?
For that you stand a mile apart,
no matter how I am breaking down.
But you, the only one to be, I not sure if it's so.
Perhaps, the vulgarities of love, what woe it brings.
Just like that, for a moment more, while I still can see your smile.

<strong>Don’t, no longer be here. I'm not going to ask you to stay no more.</strong>

We dream and this is how it ends.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A piece of choking tirade? An erraneous note to be combusted?
Maybe I'll break into a dance, but no, I'm not properly
attire in such occasion. On the road, what would they think even
if I could dance really well to such a mis-beat song?

No worries about me. Look, the man and woman strand, their back towards each other.
The man, with his hands fold on his chest, keeps peering at the town's clock.
The woman, only notices the reflection in her pocket mirror, pucks her lips
with freshly applied velvet lipstick.

Charming lady and gentleman, well-dress and presumably highly-educated,
would you spare a moment to share your life with me?
Could you look past these rags, and see me for who I am,
even if I would really amount to nothing much, not even to the rags?

We'll talk on the shortness of life, how could we ever reveal the meaning?
I’m betting on my future. The poverty that ensues and threatens at my heels.
No where far from broke, but I’m not the poorest to be sure.
For jobs abundance in this land, why else should I whinge?

Am I just a brat? Their eyes float over me.
I should perhaps swore to busy myself, to indulge in the busyness.
The city that bustle,
I couldn’t understand anything more any more.

Perhaps we choke, weep and combust and I'll dance to the mis-beat
in my rags on the street afterall.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With a lion snare,
a cardiac arrest.
For an elephant charge,
a seizure occurs.
In a leopard sprint,
an accident breaks.

The motion goes
and I’m rushing with a spoilt hand
on the face of the watch.

Have to go,
no, not to have,
I need it bad.

Why, oh why?
This
frustration,
this sickness in the
tummy
to get things done?

What woe
is age going
about again
now, going
now?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Never have I known this mister,
who in his absence
could summon such ache.

Maybe he is there, pretend he is here,
for no one could be sure,
this is definitely not truth for me to bear.

I wish, with my might, no matter how cheesy,
that these days would drop with ease
and the pinning of presence come to cease.

Oh my, oh my, how things unfold
to such agony and loneliness,
catching up with this emptiness?

This is perhaps best the man I know,
for the calamity to me he bestow,
ever and ever my life on toll.

But still it rolls and rolls and rolls even if it mires itself in clumsiness so they flounder and waver and
halt.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Then I was, perfect as a whole
or a half,
when, I didn’t know better.
Now, the half completes. The
gentleman, who gets beneath my skin; who
dances the song I trip upon; who
amplifies the life I journey through,
breathes the rhythm as I do.
He,
I believe to know better, myself or whosoever,
but it doesn’t go so. The intense shadow still
follows
these sparkles of adoration. So then,

tell me, what good is of love, when I
could have done better without knowing.
Why are we to be put through these
nebulous sufferings and aches?
Why are we so fooled and twirled
by the ones we so believe to love?
Tell me, what good is love?

But what good is love when there is no better;
no better is the love that is
withheld;
no better is the love that is
treaded carefully;
no better is the love that we don’t
fully relinquish
ourselves
Into the bliss; no better is the love that is
reserved exclusively for
tomorrow.

Still for all that I could have mentioned,
Tell me, for what good is love when this
love,
even with its indestructible nature, goes
so bad?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I stand looking out of the window from the 26th storey.</h2>
I am high above the people on the streets; they look just like ants marching on the street. And cars, they form a long strand of disconnected metal capsules that sprawl on the highway with an almost equal distance in between. Everyone seems to be heading the same way, walking in the same direction and even the cars are more densely packed on one side of the road.

The people on the streets are chocked with official-looking neatly pressed clothes.

Everybody wishes to look their best and make a mark, whatever that means.
<h2>I stand on the 26th storey, wandering about their thoughts and lives.</h2>
How many have tears behind these well-presented façade? How many endure the drudgery of the day because of the responsibilities that they hold, their families, their kids, their parents, their spouses? Is it because of the things that they need to have or because of the wealth they wish to build?

The universe so loves to throw me around on the highs of life and plunge me down to the lowest. Especially when I am doing something for money, it never seems to work out, just like the state I am in now. I am the lowest sprawling in this office, just a mere data entry temp that earns $7.50 per hour. Yes, there is no need for secret over here. The one who is assigned tasks that nobody else wishes to do but there is nothing much that I could complain about because this is the path that I choose, for now.

I do not wish to be involved in the complications of the corporate world.

I don’t see a point in me doing my part merely for the money.
<h2>But here I am, all because I need a job.</h2>
Would this work out? I have to. I keep reminding myself that this is the necessary step to propel me to my next step of my dreams. Sometimes, we just have to make do with what the universe throw at us and make the best out of it. There would be obstacles, and doing something that I don’t like to get the necessary resources is just one of them.

I don’t wish to get all lofty about my dreams because there is really no need to. Somewhere, in the heart of everybody, there is a dream budding and one just needs to pay attention to realize its existence. When that happens, every step that one takes, one would feel responsible for it.

We would no longer be putting up our hands and claiming that we do not have the choice.
<h2>Here, I am responsible for choosing this job, standing at a high point of 26th storey, yet remaining low on hierarchy.</h2>
But this isn’t important, status and money aren’t as important as the feeling and perspective we have. This is a learning opportunity. One that I could learn to humble myself to be grateful of the job, one that I could humble myself to the judgment of people, one that I could humble myself to the irate by people when I make mistakes at work, one that I could humble myself to understand why some choices are deemed necessary, one that I could humble myself to just practically everything that is happening in my universe.
<h2>For when we are humble, we could really appreciate the greatness presented to us by the revelation and pursuit of our dreams.</h2>

		<title>Time to ditch the naysayers persona and take action for your dreams NOW!</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/take-action-for-your-dreams-now/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this world, there are 2 groups of people – the do-ers and the nay-sayers. Of course we could further subdivide it into various smallest groups, depending on a person character, but that is going in too deep. Whatever it is, you are a nay-sayers if you are not a do-ers. There is no in between.
<h2>Let me tell you this, even a dreamer is a nay-sayers if they are not a do-ers.</h2>
<strong>Because a dream without action is as good as not having any.</strong>

In fact, I believe that a dreamer who never does anything is just gearing themselves towards depression.

They have such a wonderful perception of their inner world and when their external situation does not coincide with their inner world, tension within them will increase. And soon, they would lose faith in their dreams because they could only notice the huge gap they have to get across for their dreams. They have all these amazing ideas within them yet they do not take actions because they do not have enough faith for it. They would cover this up with the excuse, “This is going to have to wait for tomorrow when I have more money and more time.” And the same excuse repeats itself till one day they bury this dream with their excuses.
<h2>Then, there is my favourite group of people, the do-ers, the action takers.</h2>
They dream, set plans and take their step, one at a time. They might be working and pursuing their dream during their free time. It might take them a bit longer but it doesn’t matter. Slowly but steadily, they are inching towards their goals. This progress gives them tangible results. Even if the result might not be the result they wanted, they are given a chance to learn a lesson from it. Hopefully, with this experience, they could make a better choice in the next round.
<h2>Actions are important for dreamers.</h2>
Heck, conscious actions are important for everyone, who wishes to go beyond just staying alive, to lead an interesting life.

When we see that there is no future down the route that we are taking, we would deviate from the path. That is why we have to do things without reading obsessively into the future. Instead of thinking of how much further we still have, sometimes, we have to take a step back to recount how far we have journeyed to continue it. Knowing the fact that we have walked so far is empowering to how much further we could walk.
<h2>Think back to the moments when we label it as the worst part of our life.</h2>
<strong>We survive anyway, isn’t it?</strong>

That is why we are still here. Then come the next worst thing in your life but somehow we survived again anyway.

But for those who are still struggling, take heart that you would survive if you are to hold on. You would emerge stronger and more bright-eyed. But be careful not to give in to skepticism.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>maybe the wind is blowing it off.
perhaps we are crazy from the start
to believe in those kiddish fairy tales.</em>

for we are wanderers. life's amazing,
we dream and too much, we hold on to.

we think it possible
when reality knows other plans

our hearts have crossed
but our callings differ.

one day, you would wake me up for goodbye,
but we would never know when,
this knowledge, i could live without.

still, for you and you alone,
i dream, i do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You can’t experience it all somebody told me.
You won’t be successful this way,
jumping from hobby to hobby.

Got to find purpose in what you’re trying to achieve
I was dumb and mute, no form of
armories of words to proceed.

Then I wander with my ponderous mind,
how could I choose in life
when everything I did is magical;
it leads me to where I need to be.

The drivers have a collection of stories,
the man by the sea sings of the waves.
And the rabbit knows which foot to put in the hole.

Is success all that we have to be fighting for?
Just a world for the elite?
If it's true, how is it possible that I don’t know
where I’m heading to?

Lost, I still am. But I know my choice,
betray my will, I can't. I can't
when life makes me Alice, in this wonderland.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lying stiff on the bed,
on a count of five days and more.
Agony seizes the brain. It captures the heart
of the one beside, they don't really get
what's going on.

To hassle for the medication, they would only do.
But masking the symptoms isn't the same
as being cure. I try to speak but words are so weak indeed.
It's a virus, don't they know? The fever suppressor doesn't do much
except affect the number on the thermometer.

You get better if you take the med, she insists,
forcing me awake in the middle of the night.
The dizzy spell follows and I cringe on the floor. The medical staff says,
it's just some effect of the medication. Or your disease probably.

Should I worry, but nobody really does.
They have conviction in the modern medical science.
Then it comes, thoughts of banging my head to stop the spinning.
But spin and spin it still would do.
I could only wait. Till my immune system brings me back
to who I am.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The old man dances on the streets, plays the harmonica.
The old lady sits, stares, wonders if she lives to another day.

Today, they aren’t here in their spots
and us, the young ones move along their same old course.

We busy ourselves with figures and facts, the holy grail
of modern technology. The life and bustle,
the party and crowd we can’t do without.

In a box to climb and climb we could,
higher and higher, maybe we would reach the sky.
But only to discover it is an illusion of wallpaper-covered ceiling.

Where is my great life?
Where are my dreams come true?
And where are my die-hard fans?

What is real? Health? Money? Fame?
Is it true that I’m living in this world
and all I have to do is to polish the ladder all this while?

Woe upon me. Money fleets me.
And life insidiously repetitive.
Another day, another opportunity probably.

A new day arrives, but what exactly is new?
The old man croons, and the old lady cries,
today, they return.

For one more day and one more moment in their life,
they would thrive.
Still, they would have nil, and time would leave them all behind.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Letter Of Rant To My (Ex) Lover</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/a-letter-of-rant-to-my-ex-lover/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dear lover,</h2>
It has been three years since I first met you. I still find it weird whenever I say this because even after three years, I realise I don't really know you. If people were to ask me about my lover, I don't think I can get pass describing your long hair, tattoos and occupation.

<strong>To be fair, I don't think you can describe anymore than I can for you. </strong>

You don't even know my occupation and you don't know what I love to do. I just realise you never ask anything about my daily life. I guess, it doesn't matter to you. When we are together, you just want to talk about you, you and you. Sure, your stories are interesting but I would appreciate some attention on my side. I'm not a pet dog to keep by your side.

But perhaps, you are over zealous when we meet. You know we don't meet very often, just once a year, like the characters in a fairytale of the Chinese: the cowherd and weaving girl. Do you want to hear more about the story? I know you don't want to, you are never really quite keen about my culture are you? Except for your interest in the Chinese tea, you don't really know anything Chinese.

<strong>Our cultures are world apart and so are our viewpoints on a relationship.</strong>

Because you are my first lover (even when I have dated different guys in between), I would dedicate my life to you if you were to do the same. But what I learn that day is appalling, that you couldn't exactly tell me the number of girls you have at the current moment. And yes, I do know that you would have other girls, given your criteria and the state of our relationship but I am not expecting so many. You tell me that you didn't want to commit because you are hurt deeply by the death of your wife. I'm very sorry for your wife and I could understand why you choose to live life the way you are now.

You are always traveling in between countries for your work and you think it is unfair to let a girl wait for you for months. Or rather, let's face the truth, that you think it is unfair for you to wait for months. When you ask me whether I think I could wait for six to eight months for you, I want to tell you badly that it has been three years, what matter is a few months?

But then, me in my dreaded teary face did not want to hear anything from you anymore. My heart has just been shredded by your indifference, like this is just the way thing is and you won't do anything to change it. It is nothing more than a fantasy love story on my part. And for you, I'm nothing but just someone conveniently passing by that you could reel in.

<strong>You show me that I don't mean anything to you, even when you try to convince me otherwise. </strong>

I have been trying to break off this relationship since two years ago and you know I like you too much to stand by my resolution if you say you still want me. And you play this to your advantage, despite the fact that you have other girls around you. You tell me that you think it is a pity and that you want everything to continue. You don't think about the impact of your words and you have me thinking that you truly care about me.

<strong>Maybe you did, as with all other girls that you have. </strong>

You just happen to have a big heart full of love to dedicate enough for every other girls. But I'm done with your so called care, I'm done with missing you and I'm done with waiting for months for your reply. I don't want you anymore, even if you were to say you change and that you want to settle down with me. I know this would just be lies and you would never say that, you love your current life too much. A girl in each continent, this kind of lifestyle suits you well, doesn't it? I'm too blindly in love to see that I'm just one of your statistics. I just can't see the fact that you're keeping me by your side and slotting me into a convenient time slot to meet you. I bet you have a mental calendar of girls to meet and you are keeping track of it well.

<strong>I don't want a lover like you anymore. </strong>

I don't want to pin my heart on someone who doesn't take me seriously. Stop sending my emails saying that you miss me when you are hugging somebody else. It doesn't work anymore. I'm not getting any younger by the year. I am not wasting any more of my youth on you. I don't hate you, we have spend some good moments together and you show me that dreams are worth pursuing. In fact, I'm really glad to meet you, you change my life for the better. You are just not a faithful lover, the kind I'm looking for, and I am done with being tangle up in a mess with you.

<strong>I wish you happiness. </strong>

But I don't think that is necessary as you have already found in each and every girl. One less girl doesn't add to your agony anyway. For all the pain that you have given me through the years, I could only hope for the day that they would make me wiser and guide me to the right man, someone who truly care, someone unlike you.
<p style="text-align: right;">Somebody once,
Wing</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Paradox Of Freedom</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/the-paradox-of-freedom/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Friend A: Why restrict ourselves so much? Be free like a bird. </strong>
<strong> Me: Even a bird needs the strength of its wings and the wind to go where it needs to go.</strong>
<h2>Freedom is a much abused word in our society nowadays.</h2>
We think of freedom as the ability to do what we really want to do, say going on a heli-ski holiday on impulse, buying the branded bag, buying the sports car and skipping work the next day just because you don’t feel like doing it. The list just goes on. In our modern lifestyle, it becomes admirable to have this kind of freedom, to be so rich that everything else in the world is just dust to you.

But, if we take the same example and look at it deeper, we find that freedom, all kind of freedoms, but in this case, let’s stick to financial freedom, requires discipline and effort. Unless you are born as some mega-billionaire heir or heiress. To get to that level of freedom through the legal way, we need to put in hours of work building the financial portfolio, we need to understand the economy and make wise investment. We also need a job, preferably something that gives us considerable dough, to bring in the seed money to do the things aforementioned.
<h2>Freedom requires us to sacrifice some of our time.</h2>
Freedom is not the response to the whims of the mind, it is not about doing what you want to do all the time.

<strong>Our range of freedom is in respect to the proximity of others. </strong>

For example, the freedom to swing my arm is in respect to the proximity of your face. It is not wrong to swing my arms in the public, but if I hit your face, obviously I have committed an error. You are free to eat the whole tub of ice-cream but you are not free to control the adverse effect it would have on your body. For me, I could have saved up money and backpack around the world, but when I return, I have to face the difficulty of integrating into life back home.
<h2>The freedom, as propagate by modern day living, comes at a cost, sometimes, a very high cost.</h2>
If we work towards this kind of freedom, financial ability to fuel our incessant consumerism needs so as to attain happiness, we are just slave to our minds. Our minds are telling us that we need this and this and that to make us happy. They are telling us that we need external stimuli: high post, thick wad of money, branded bags, condo and sports car, to make ourselves happy. There is nothing with having all these. We need people in high positions for things to work out in the world and I believe in hierarchy. Also, there are some very famous spiritual people who are also very successful entrepreneurs and drive around in sports car.

It is a mistake to associate spiritual people with an ascetic life. Sure, some of the spiritual people choose to live simply because they want to make deeper connections with the things around them. Becoming a vegetarian, as what is known to be a restrictive diet to most, has connected me to compassion. It is a delusion to think that I don’t kill for my meal (agricultural activities result in and result from mass killing), but at least, I know that I did not intentionally put animals through cruel breeding methods to feed myself.

The important thing is to not associate ourselves with external things and labels, in order to achieve the true freedom. For example, if I’m a vegetarian that associates me with having a holier-than-thou diet, I would discriminate the meat lovers and ultimately restrict my freedom to make friends.
<h2>Liberation, the true freedom is about seeing things as it is.</h2>
It is about understanding that you are connected to the Supreme Being and ultimately all are made of the same consciousness.<strong> All are divine and falls into the grand scheme of the universe, whatever it is.</strong> Then, this liberation, that is ignited from within, from being able to find joy in the seemingly mundane things, admiring a bird song, waking up the next day, drinking water, moving our limbs, would put us into the place where we have to be.

This would bring us to the subject of contentment.

<strong>Even the idea of contentment is skewed nowadays. </strong>

Contentment is not about being happy with where you are and staying put in life. Contentment is about being grateful with what you have and subsequently, doing what you have to do without attachment to the results. The way things go are not 100 percent within our control.

<strong>If we really analyse the probability of future success, we would regard everything as impossible. </strong>

Because impossible means that it hasn’t been done by people beforehand, thus it hasn’t been valid in history and would be highly subjected to failure. Jane Goodall has been scorned on by countless scientists in her early days but she is now a recgonised primatologist. She could be wrong about primates having a distinct character when she first starts, but she carries on with faith (hard work and discipline too, sounds familiar?) and succeeds in proving herself right.
<h2>So freedom, or rather liberation is about detachment and discipline.</h2>
Putting detachment and discipline together seems to be an oxymoron. If you are detached from the world, you won’t be practicing anything. When you are not attached to anything, you would not commit to any forms of practice. If I’m not attached to animals, I wouldn’t become a vegetarian. To be disciplined, I have to practice, but to invite liberation into my life, I have to detach myself from my practice. If I’m too attached to my practice, or rather, the result of my practice, I might become over competitive and hurt myself during practice. (Yes, hurt my hamstrings many times during my yoga practice).

<strong>Freedom is relative, that is what yoga practice teaches me. </strong>

The freedom to fold our body forward is not just about having long hamstring. It’s about the relationship of the quadriceps, the muscles of the hips with the hamstring. Also, it is about our emotional states that allow ourselves to work towards the posture. If we hold a lot of depressed thoughts, we might always be seen slouching. And if we did open up our chest, we would free up the emotions in your body. If we cannot open up our backs, it might means that we are holding up a lot of unconscious and/or unexpressed feelings.

<strong>The freedom, or plainly put our flexibility is not just about practice, it is also about letting go in order to move into another plane.</strong>

Just take a look at me, people thinks that I’ve been living my life free to pursue my dreams but it comes at a cost, lots of judgment and lots of self-deprecating thoughts. If I don’t have the mental capability to hold myself up during this period of time, I would not be where I am now. (Though I’m probably also nowhere now but I’m closer everyday)

So you see, freedom is hard work after all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The wind soars, bringing the particles with them.
Bounding by, mangling with, do they feel stagnant too?
Do their breath slow and deepen into desperation?

The cigarette is lited up, hung between his fingers.
His face wears a blank. Smoke escaping towards the sky.
How freely they go, whirling and twirling in their new found company.

The runners are forcing their lungs, still, as usual,
the street soccer court isn't wallowing alone.
Kids are out with their bicycles. Something hangs.

They slash and cut. We lament and complain.
They don't know a thing about the environment,
and we would do so much better.

But whose fault is it really?
The economy driving, the agricultural practices flourishing.
The consumer really isn't responsible for anything.
Soley due to the proprietor, he does what it needs be.
And we, just commoners, have no say, don't we?

Would you try, to see if you could hear the sorrowfulness in the cat?
To see the flowers suffocating?
A new layer of grey dust coats the leaves, do you reckon
they learn to adapt?

We talk, we all do. In somewhere, it is written
with the belief of man's dominion over nature.
So we slash and cut
ourselves. He
puffs air into my eyes.
Truth, as I see, is layered in this haze.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Days of dreams and lovely beings.
Across the rainbow skies, they spin.
Mermaids sing and sailors sway.
Flower elves mend the shoes for me.

Years of truth and living in, we are now too old
for fairytales ending. The sag in our faces
say too much. Botox, perhaps we all need.
Money and bills clutter our minds.
Our hands busily on the assignment
we must complete. For peace of mind
and future ease. This is how they say
we should live.

A lifetime of me who I pursue. I say
gawky it turns out to be.
A twenty three old in a kid’s charade
still.
But isn't all just a game make believed
by minds of
the restlessness
and
the competitive?

Where could I stand and where should I be?
When all I want is to twirl around
to the beats of the drum
that fall deaf
on the ears of
one
too many.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I walk on this street, nearly Christmas it would be.
Seeing the couples, as I pass them by,
in secrecy
of their kind. Languages travel so softly
as if it would wake the night.

Maybe my heart has once fallen into a place more silent than
the sleep of night. But still, you couldn’t hear the whisperings
when you decide to just go,
off to far away.

How is it like to live as who you are and to be where you are?
For this festive break, do you have
another person who kisses you at night?
Or do you, too, feel that Santa couldn't care?

I wish you could have known that
for souls that stray, the love could have stayed,
but you decidely choose your way.
The words you used to say, their time have gone,
but I’m still left at the spot we've last been.

I never could go too far away, just never am.
Here I stay, counting the wind that passes,
in sheer solitude, it is. No joy and solemness within.
Always, until a pinning heart finds its' place
to live.

Merry Christmas,
even if you no longer wish of me at all.]]></content:encoded>

<!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;-->
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Dear Wing,</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">How are you feeling today? Hope you are doing fine. It might appear sudden for me to write you this letter but I have so many things that I wish to tell you, so please hear me out. I have known you for 23 years, but you still mean a lot to me. We are going into 2014, a new year soon and I look forward to spending it beautifully with you. I hope you are as excited as I am. I see what you have done over the years, and I’m proud of you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I know that you probably think that you are nothing great, just a simple person but you are just exactly who you need to be. If I could imagine you to be a lady in the Victorian Era, you would be someone who dresses as a horse groomer even if that is not neccessary what you do for a living. You would pull it off with knee high boots and black vest over a slightly off-white shirt with your long hair bun in a gray cloth sports cap. You could walk in the woods for hours regardless of the season in your attire. Most of the times, you would walk alone and some unusual times, you would grab a friend or two to hang out in your secret hide out. You don’t really need the company, but you feel bad about hiding such a wonderful place to yourself. You love the squirrels that scatter after the acorns, and you could be mesmerized starring at the clouds when it is not too sunny. If you carry a book with you to your hideout, you would be gone in the story plot for hours till you couldn't even hear the birds around you.</p>

<h2 class="MsoNormal">You are unique in your own ways, always living your life with passion.</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even when everyone else would disagree, you hold to your belief. Then again, you are flexible to change your decisions for the best of the moment. Nobody could really understand you and your way of working. You are amazing to me, young, intelligent, beautiful and kind. Now, before you scorn off everything that I have said, I said it from the bottom of my heart. Right now, at this moment, I wish I could hug you close to make you understand. I wish to said that during moments when you are not feeling alright, although you are always smiling, I’m here for you. I wouldn’t leave too far away from you, for you are the love of my life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But I also wish to tell you, love, the truth about your life. I wish to let you know that it is okay to show that you wish to take a break. It is not a sign of helplessness, it is just the way we all are. Some things we are good at it, and certain things would take us ages to figure out. You don’t have to do all the things alone, you don’t have to carry the burden of your stories alone. You are someone filled with love, but sometimes you have to learn to be a little more realistic. Be bold, and have the courage to admit that you have been wrong or that you couldn't carry on anymore and wish to take a break from this crazy world. It pains me to see that you push yourself so hard sometimes, getting involved in things all over the world. Still, you always wish for just a little bit more achievement. I know that deep inside you, you still reprimand yourself about how worthless you are.</p>

<h2 class="MsoNormal">And the orphan tears at night, you know, someday it would be alright.</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">But trust me, even at this moment, everything is fine and you are just where you need to be. Life is a journey which nobody have the right answers for. Take some time to enjoy this trip, relish in the happy moments in your life and learn from the disappointment that you encounter. You’ll be fine, and I would always be here for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: right;">Love,
Myself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://wingfootprint.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/sunrise.jpg"></a>2013, the number I breeze and end
with tears, smiles and love abound.
A new year of thrill, or would
it be just days that pass by.
Could I say that I would do what I need to do
and that I would finally get it right?

For years, I search and discover,
only to get lost, time after time.
Those were the days, I feel right and wrong,
and know that I'm a clue no where near.
Could this be the way life is?

But the lady boss with rich assets, of money to last generations
to come, though being a barren wife, says "Man is
mistaken to think they have free will. So all they do is give
excuses of searching and searching for a long time they do.
So wrong they have lived. Young people are getting stupid, even if
their pay is high. The system is corrupted and so that it is.
I’ve no religion and I’m God because I create, nuture and destroy whoever, whatever I wish."
She proclaims, dominating the table of conversation.
What confidence she has. But those eyes, were seemingly showing
loneliness of a woman of an unloved life.
I stay silent, what words could have entered meaning to her?
I am not wise as yet, and it isn’t a day for combat. And I could be wrong once more.

But secretly I say to myself,
this year, with a unique start, a long way to go.
Or would I foolishly turn it
to be a continuation of the undesirable from the past?
I’ll hang on around enough till I know best.
I dance to my own rhythm and listen to my own breath.
Maybe I learn not to lament and whine
over the much miseries of this land
but discover a way to bring back light
lost in a depraved society.
In a new form, it might be.
Words that are lost, but maybe it'll turn out fine.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Have you met a man who travels?</h2>
He could be tall, short, slim, plump, brown eyes, blue eyes, black hair, blonde, tan, pale, asian, caucasian and african. The point is he could be anybody of any age and of any race. But you know a man who travels when you meet one. No, not that they all have the same personalities, some of them would take longer than others to open up, while some instantenously feel like old pals.

<strong>But you would know one because he goes along with the constant flow of life, as if he is a manta ray gliding in the ocean. </strong>

He has lots of stories to share, from hitchiking across America to staying with the villagers in Uzbekistan. He could speak in the same sentence of poverty of the world and the villagers' contentment despite the abject living conditions. He might tell you that the world is corrupted but encourages to do your very best for the world. But whatever he say, he say it with passion, even if it is also with contradiction.

You might be lucky to meet him at the funny moment of his life, whereby he is staying for a while in a country. By a while, I mean anything ranging from months to years. You might get to know him a little bit better. Maybe you would become close friends with him and inevitably fall in love with his quirkiness. It might be destined for him to fall in love with your special way of being too.

There is no match make in heaven and no soul mates meant to be if you never wish to let go of the comfort of singlehood and take the risk to plunge into his world.
<h2>He may not be there for long, maybe for a year or so.</h2>
You could be spending more time counting months of absence than actually being with him. You might be devastated that he decides to leave one day to settle somewhere else. And estactic to know that he is back again. You deliriously schedule all of your life events around him whenever he is here because you know he is unpredictable and you never know if he would be here for long.

<strong>To be honest, you couldn't quite decide if you love or hate his unpredictability. </strong>

Perhaps, such is the beauty of this connection, a beauty that nobody else could comprehend. They all warn you against such a relationship, didn't they?

But both of you make a cute couple and things have been going better than fine. His sense of freedom begins to rub a little onto you, and you too learn to appreciate more of living with the flow. You begin to perceive the world differently, it becomes a world of hope and possibilities.
<h2>It could be the beginning of the best of your life.</h2>
He knows that nobody really knows what is going to happen and the most we could do is to be grateful of today and make the most out of it. He reminds you to fall deeply in love with the world, that the world is not just about a nine to five. There are forests to explore, rivers to sail, oceans to dive, mountains to climb and most importantly, people to connect to. He knows that every small action might account to something bigger and that everyone could make a difference to the world, changing the world to be a better place for all to live in.

<strong>And all this wouldn’t happen if you do not allow yourself to get lost in his gaze. </strong>

Look into his eyes and see for yourself how they speak of an exotic-ness of the countries he has visited. Sometimes, it is a steady fiery gaze that tells you the scars of his fights and triumph of his battles. While other times, you could never really tell anyway.

<strong>If you ever fall in love with such a man, learn to appreciate all his nuances. </strong>

His need for some alone time and his vulnerability in living in the unknown. He might have wounds that he never wishes to share and he appreciates that you never pry.
<h2>This could be the love of your life.</h2>
<strong>Even if time might not be on your side.</strong>

If he decides to stay, all would be good for both of you. But one day, he might leave, to continue his adventures and perhaps to tell his stories to another girl. Maybe he holds her hands in the deep of the night under the stars on the beach, telling her how beautiful she really is, just like how he does with you. Maybe this could be an illusion for her and perhaps for him too. But how the story would unfold could never be precisely pinpointed unlike what all the fortune tellers hope you to believe in.
<h2>It might come a time when you just have to let him go.</h2>
<strong>But take heart that some lovers, no matter how far away, are never apart. </strong>

Maybe he picks up some of your habits or maybe he starts talking like you. You might just appear in his mind in the most unexpected time and you might even receive an email or message from him in the middle of the night.

No matter what happens, love him for who he truly is. Because no matter where he is, he will live with a piece of memory of you, just as he lives in you too.
<h2>And this is the way you love a man who travels.</h2>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Come, let's drink tea,
we could talk about life,
debate about ethics and love,</p>
while the world is spinning,
corroding. Squatters crying,
babies dying, temperature rising.

But none of these is important,
not compared to the tea we drink.

We need to talk about issues
because that is our purpose lie,
to accompany this tea to be finished.
Don't you think?

From within, the light astounding.
Doubt not, esoteric it wouldn't be
but in every bit its' practicality.
What else could life amount,
if we merely busy down to naught?</p>
With pure soul residing, we can choose clarity.
Move, meditate and breathe
for well-being and sound living.
Focus, listen and discover the gift within,
in each of our unique capabilites.
Live, love and be grateful,
for happiness simply is.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Spiritual Pursuit: I&#039;m A Broke, Ohm-Chanting And Time Altering Dragon</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to Saturday. </strong></h2>
<strong>These days repeat themselves.</strong>

Another day, or maybe the same old yet different day. The escalator transports me upwards to the exit of the MRT station. It’s 3.25pm, work will start at 3.30pm. I am wearing a blue T-shirt that shouts volunteer at the back, and a knee-length navy blue yoga pants. I think I have worn them together last week and perhaps on a Tuesday too. Upon exiting the MRT station, a huge display screen of the shopping mall plays the same advertisement, which I can’t help but notice despite the fact that I never give much attention to this buzz. Most of the advertisements bully you to the way they think it is best for you to live.
<h2>Let’s go back to the morning.</h2>
I have a yoga class, the weekly practice session that will prepare me to be a teacher. That is why I’m carrying my yoga mat to work. It starts at 10.30am, I must have reached around 10.35am. Everyone in class is sitting cross-legged with their eyes close, with the voice of my yoga teacher sailing through the air. If there are divine beings, this is the place they will choose to reside. I try to walk silently, not wanting my intrusion to break their focus. But the nature of the dance floor makes it impossible to take a step without announcing my arrival. It screeches away defiantly no matter how light I tread. Once, I remember I was lying down and somebody walked around my head and I thought I am going to be trample by an elephant. Still, with an outward look of poise, nobody so much as move even their eyes. If this is in a forest, a squirrel might just land on one of their laps. I am not like them, I would be fidgeting and guessing who it is each time someone walks across the room. But luckily, they are not me. I flow into the practice, feeling at ease and abandoning any thoughts that I have intruded the practice. Practice, in all solemnness should be practical and present. One should try to clear the disturbances of one’s mind during practice. It is to observe and let go whatever surfaces and bring our focus back to the practice. Indeed, it is not going to be fairies prancing around magical toadstool or even prayer circles to wish for the ever elusive world peace, a slogan of the flower children in the hippie years, accompanied with long beards, filth-accumulating naked bodies and bare foot.
<h2>At 12pm.</h2>
<strong>We give our thanks and ready ourselves for the world. </strong>

The beauty of yoga is flow and the composure to face changes. The yoga class has ended and is ended. Today is the last day of our weekly session. It has been eight months since it all begins. Sometimes it feels that there is a deep transformational power within me, like a dragon arising from her century-long slumber, ready to soar. I’m ready for whatever the world is going to throw at me and I will face it with zen and peace. Yes, there are days which I thought I know what Buddha must have been through, living off nothing but feeling contentment and being dedicated to the arduous task of spreading his teachings. Because I live with nothing, relatively and I proclaim myself the great spiritual seeker who can subsist on the minimal. Of course, I can live with all this illusion until it is time to pay for my bills and I need to seek help from my parents. I felt like a hypocrite with a balloon for chest puncture at this very moment. I cannot live next to nothing. For that, I'm sure Buddha doesn’t have to pay bills. Definitely the electricity, water and food did not come about because I sow seeds of love through the universe. Everything, of course is being well taken care of by my parents.
<h2><strong> 18 March 2014.</strong></h2>
<strong>It might not be so different from 18 March 2010 after all.</strong>

I transform yet I am also back to where I begin, the lost and broke-ass kid of lofty dreams, living an idealistic life, traversing upon leaps and mountains of disapproval of others. Today, at twenty four, five years of searching, having been through what should be an incredible journey towards light and enlightenment, I am still in debts. The love did not manage to convince my local government to dissolve my debts. They would probably tell me to be grateful that they did not increase the interest rate. To them, I’m just a hobo. And so be it. God, Buddha, or whoever up there did not patronize my efforts of tender love towards their creations or universal consciousness or oneness or divinity or nothingness. I am not even close, maybe I’m the wolf in sheep clothing in the spiritual world, in which I believe that I’m a sheep.
<h2>Year 2014.</h2>
I am still greedy and with many desires in my life that it is in complete opposition in the practice of contentment. Even when it is nearing the end of my yoga teacher training, I am still sitting on the fence of six thousand dollars of debt (my polytechnic school fees and part of my yoga teacher training fees) and of living off my parents shamelessly.

Even when I’m positioned precariously, with the danger of falling to the abyss of immobility, I am planning for my next dive trip (which might pan out to a diving instructor license), hankering for Bali to learn tribal fusion belly dance (which might develop into a dance career of being the firs local performing tribal fusion dancer and even dreaming of scoring a permaculture certification (which will give me the courage to propose to the government of granting me some land to garden).

Still after <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/5-facts-about-our-spine-for-yoga-part-2/">eight months of yoga pursuit</a>, in which I learn that yoga essentially means a state of clarity, I am an unstable and highly unreliable human being. Instead of becoming more clear-eyed about the one thing that I should devote myself to, I morph into a multi-headed, ohm-chanting, serene looking, juice-sipping dragon or if you prefer wolf in sheep’s skin.

Before I discredit myself any further, there is at least one thing that I am living in accordance to the philosophy of yoga. It is that I should do my best without attaching myself to the results. I’m taking this path seriously and flowing with the wind throughout my efforts to soar.
<h2><strong>Today.</strong></h2>
<strong>I am biologically twenty four, spiritually nutcase, monetary broke, but at least physically and mentally, I feel at my best.</strong>

As if my erected spine has free itself from the messy affair with gravity. The lower half of my body is grounded like it should be, but I could stand as if heaven has attached a string to my upper half of my body. Maybe there is a help line send from up above after all. My belly dance teacher says, when you stand straighter, your boobs looks bigger, your waist looks smaller and you naturally walks with more ease and your dance becomes smooth. This is how I feel, as if I’m dancing through life. Big boobs and small waist would be pleasant but I’m fine without them. I’m light weight, despite the fact that muscles weigh more than fats. I am without traces of age lines on my face, without the impairment of the spine through constant slouching in modern day living. With my suppleness, I am going through the best ride of my life, at this moment.

Maybe, I turn back time or maybe the way I’m living is simply topsy-turvy. It seems yesterday is a far shot but eight months ago is just within stretch and tomorrow, who knows. Time is a funny thing and the only logical thing one could do is to be present. And maybe, if I hang on a little more, I would have wings strong enough to soar with the multi heads of my greedy dragon. I would be able to piece it all together and live through it as a whole.

<strong>But now is not the time to worry because I am truly at the <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/young-wild-and-free-by-a-twenty-four/">best moment of my life</a>.</strong>

<em>Note: This weekend will be the last of my 8 months yoga teacher training course. It has been an enriching time with my wonderful and dedicated teacher, Nitya of <a href="http://www.svastha.net/singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Svastha Yoga</a>. She runs teacher training courses, private yoga sessions and yoga therapy. </em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Love Letter To All My Naysayers</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/a-love-letter-to-all-my-naysayers/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dear you,

I know that you have doubts in me and make passing remarks on my life. I wish to hide my intentions no further, I want to thank you and tell you that I love you. I know that I don’t present myself as the most reliable person in the world and no amount of smiles could assure you of the credibility of my life. I know that you look at me in disdain and of pity.

But I know that beneath, you also look to me as a person who is living the life you secretly yearn.

I wish I could tell more but I never once wish to present my struggles to others.

Call it pride, call it ego, but I don’t think other deserve to see me breaking into tears and be lost at such situations. There are times when I cried publicly and nobody knows what to do. I know better now that it is better for me to remain as my own strongest pillar of support. There are times when I look back into my life, and am both amazed and discouraged by it. So I learn that all will be well if I focus on the present, to do what I could to live this moment to the best.
<h2><strong>But today, I want to tell you the truth.</strong></h2>
I want to tell you a little more about what I feel.

I feel that sometimes, the whole world is against me, even though we know this is not true and it is just an overly active imagination on my part. The whole world doesn’t really care about who I am though people do make it a big deal about my life whenever they are with me. I know I am broke and living off my parents and haven’t quite manage to excel in life. I know I am an underachiever to you but what about happiness and health? Since when has it been wrong to put them as priorities?

When you are against me, I pray that one day that you will make peace with the discomfort that I have caused you. I try very hard to remain unsettled by your comments. I know words are usually coloured by perceptions and experiences and don’t necessary apply.

But do you know how hard it is, having to pull through years and years of negativity thrust at me? But you and others are not me and you don’t understand, you don’t need to understand. Yes, there are too many times that I am confused and lost and wish to look for guidance, but who could I turn to if nobody understand?

Through the years, I learn that at least, I could still be honest to myself. If I’m strong enough, I could shine my own light and stand well. Courage is not a lack of fear, it is the ability to face and withstand all that come despite the uncertainties.

You are not alone in your thoughts, I know of many people who think that I am too frivolous or too young or too reckless or too stupid.
<h2>But, I still love you all, love with every possibilities.</h2>
I love you because I do not wish to think about hating people. I love you even though sometimes I am tired and wish to cry and wish that everything could change overnight. Still, I won’t change my goals in life, I have to remain centered because I need me more than anybody needs me. I, at this instance, have only me. If people do not understand my struggle, it is okay. I know how easy it is to slip into the tendency of judging. When people tell me that they have a miserable life, that they have to work in a demanding job and then turn to external and superficial items to satisfy their soul longing of love, I use to judge them and I forget they are having struggles of their own kind.

When I am younger, I would point out that they have a choice and they choose this path. But now, I understand that sometimes, we really don’t have a choice. Sometimes, we have parents too old, kids too young, houses too expensive and bills too high. Sometimes, even if they live simply, they still couldn’t make ends meet. Because this is how our society has become.
<h2>I have my own struggle just as others have theirs.</h2>
It’s lonely when nobody understand, so I learn to accept that others have to deal with their struggles in their unique ways. Sometimes, I still feel sad when people work so hard at a job they hate just to end up spending their money on branded goods or sport cars or another new IT gadget. They don’t understand their struggles, they don’t listen to the depth of their souls. At the end of the day, we are all human, wishing to connect with another beautiful soul, be it Earth, another human, animals, art form or anything else. We just want to dance in peace throughout this lifetime but it seems so ever elusive nowadays and so, we struggle.

If ever I am given a minute to speak to the whole world, I would pray that we could all learn to listen deeply to our heart’s content, hug our darkest self and let the true light being shine.
<h2>We could learn to love, all the blotches and glitches of us.</h2>
Love, even the naysayers who are really shouting envious because you are living the life they once dream of. Be grateful if you are given the chance to pursue your dream, because it is true that not everyone has the freedom to do so. Dreams are not meant for everyone, dreams are not for people with responsibilities of others' well-being. A calling is never so strong that it becomes valid to abandon your spouse and kids against their will. Maybe dreams are far-fetched to some, but we could all learn to be contented.

Contentment and a passion of living is a choice for everyone.

<a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/lets-be-an-artist-now/">Make art</a>, be creative, dance, sing, play with the kids, kiss the dog, shout I love you and really mean it, organize a picnic with the whole family, and really, really look into somebody’s eye and be present. Be yourself, maybe it involves baring your heart and breaking down in front of your loved ones. But it is alright to be you. Speak what is on your mind even if you are unconvinced but be open to suggestions. Maybe you will be shown a path to live.
<h2>But most importantly, love, love unconditionally.</h2>
Be it compassion, generosity, devotion, faith, tenderness, goodwill or gratitude, love with all your heart without expectations. It might sound crazy, but you would quickly see how free life becomes when you love like this. Love all of this, street lights, rain, sun, moon, stars, dogs, pigs, kids, neighbours, pigeons, plants, mountains, food, blue eyes, dark skin, brown eyes, Asians, Africans, Caucasian. Love, be in love with your everyday life. Love so much that it shines every movement.

I'm telling you all this because I love you. I love all my naysayers, critics and skeptics. I now know how I wish to live with others. We all have struggles of our own, sometimes, it becomes too easy to dismiss others. I don’t want to be another person who judges because I would never understand the totality of the struggle of another. At the end, we are all in this together, so why shouldn’t we choose peace?
<p style="text-align: right;">May you love, love so hard that you have no regrets in life,
Wing</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Yoga Teacher Training: Putting Together What It All Means To Me</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>23 march 2014. </em>
<h2><strong>First day</strong></h2>
Fifteen of us, students of Svastha Yoga, and a few more of lovers and family gathered in the function room to receive our certificates. This was it, eight months of study had come to an end. It was an end to attending morning classes at nine. There wouldn’t be anymore rushing in the classroom because I mismanaged the time. There wouldn’t be the gathering in a room to watch my mind drifting when I was supposed to be focusing on the breath.
<h2>Last day</h2>
But at that point, I was present, fully present. My teacher, Nitya, presented me with the certificate. It said that “This is to certify that Puah Hui Ying has successfully completed the 200-hour, 8-Month Program <a href="http://www.svastha.net/" target="_blank">Svastha Yoga of Krishnamacharya</a> in Singapore, 2013-2014”. This was a ticket to a new kind of life, an extension of trust in the ability of yoga to bring about positive changes to my life and mankind. It was an undertaking of responsibility to integrate and uphold my life in the discipline of yoga. This was what I had worked for.

<strong>This was an end.</strong> <strong>And this is the beginning.</strong>

In my class, everyone came to yoga for a different purpose and each would have a different future. The future holds a plethora of possibilities, with equally unnerving and exciting opportunities. Would you teach yoga? Would we meet? Would we keep in touch? Best of luck to you. Words like that flitted around the room holding the open-ended queries of the future. But the only thing we were sure of at that time was that we would bid each other goodbye, each with their unique experience of transformation.
<h2>My revolution</h2>
At the age of 20, I set off carving adventures and journeys in an attempt to discover the true meaning of life.

At the age of 24, upon completion of my yoga teacher training, I give up seeking for the purpose of life and enlightenment.

Because I could never give up this world. I could never give up my regular armchair internet warrior position of fussing over inequality, corrupted food practices and any other degrading acts done by mankind. I’m not a great activist but I like to think of myself as a contributor to creating a better world, with my vegan (occasionally vegetarian) diet, writing and gardening. This is my way of revolution, silent, contemplative and minimal: one meal, one article and one seed at a time.

I’m no longer sure if I could say with definite that all things happen for a purpose. Because saying so imparts a tinge of arrogance and self-importance. Yes, we are all interconnected, the thread of events do lead from one to another and we are a sum of our whole experience, but maybe the world is just created like that. No purpose and no higher calling but just a place for all beings to live. Maybe all this is a dream world which will disappear from time to time. What is real and what is not doesn’t seem so clear anymore.

In our pursuit to make sense of living, we lose sight of living.

Ultimately, all individual could be accounted for something, right down to the smallest microorganisms but it all sums down to the base line that we are doing what we do in order to live sustainably.
<h2>Finding peace</h2>
<strong>Life to me is about finding peace</strong>. We could choose to live our lives with both effort and ease. We accept moments of good times, but we also learn to be in the moment of bad times too. Life is about being in the moment. Focusing too much of the future brings about attachments and expectations. Focusing too much on the past brings about depression and grief.

Having say so, the past and the future do play an important role in our lives, we learn from our past experiences and we find motivation in our future goals. It is about finding the balance among the three, future, past and present, for empowerment and inspiration to live with effort and ease.

I embraced every bit of my life, be it struggling to pay for my dance lessons or be it getting overjoyed from the growth of my plants. Each with its impermanence works seamlessly as an opportunity for growth. Nothing less and nothing more. Over the years, I realise that I am nothing but I am everything all at once. I believe there is something that is greater than life and I am part of it. I am the paradoxical line that sails the drift of two opposing currents. I have enough but I’m ready for more. This is my yoga, embracing myself as a broken whole, accepting all of me with conviction without attached expectations.

This is what yoga is to me. It builds a pillar of strength and peace within me even during times of confusion and adversity. Regardless of the stage I’m at, I just am where I need to be.

<strong>Today and for all the todays that I have, I am here. </strong>

		<title>Not Beyond The Material World - This Is My Yoga</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/material-yoga-in-this-world/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just for a moment, close your eyes and tune in to your body. Inhale, feel your chest rising and your body opening up. Exhale, pull your belly in and up and feel your body closing in. Feel the subtle movement: the extension and the relaxation of your spine.

Upon each inhalation, feel yourself taking in energy.

Upon each exhalation, feel yourself releasing negativity.

This is our natural state of being. Just you and you alone, hear the gentle symphony in the rhythm of your breath and feel the sublime dance in the wave of your spine.
<h2><strong>My material yoga</strong></h2>
<strong>It is about awareness.</strong>

There wouldn’t be any pretzel poses. The most intense poses would possibly be Uttana Mayurasana or Urdhva Dhanurasana or headstand. There wouldn’t be praises if you could do a posture perfectly, because there is no such thing as a perfect posture. Similarly, there wouldn’t be negative comments of jeering and discouragement if you cannot go into a posture.

I’m not here to judge you according to how nice you look in a posture. I am not here to prepare your body for yogalympics. There shouldn’t be a competition between you and your neighbours or your body and your ego. What is important is how you move into the postures, how you coordinate your breathing with the movement, which muscles you engage, how you maintain the dynamics of stay and what is the state of mind when all these are happening.
<h2>A mindful movement</h2>
Because this is what the physical aspect of yoga is about, increase awareness. So Yoga is for anybody, the forty-kilos, the hundred-kilos, the stiff, the flexible, the pragmatic, the practical, the spiritual, the OCD and the star-gazer. There are many styles of yoga that speak in different forms to people of different needs.

Personally, I don’t think my life has anything to do with the alignment of the star or horoscope or my birthday. I have no interest in meeting anyone who call themselves an enlightened person or guru of a higher plane. Having said that, I am still happy to meet anyone who has something valuable and practical to share with me. And that usually go to mean almost everybody who is sincere to make a connection.
<h2>Modern day yoga</h2>
<strong>Yoga as a mean to clarity has less to do with mystical and psychedelic experience and more of application of its teaching to day to day living, especially in an unbalanced world in this time of ours.</strong>

I love this world so much that I do not seek an out of the world experience.

I do not seek to transcend through the physical plane, astral plane and so forth. Enlightenment sounds like a boring place when I have so much living to do. If there is reincarnation, I don’t care what I am being reborn into. As a gardener, I love my worms and my bugs. Secretly, I think they are having a fun time. You can see that I put true value on this material world. I seek to find my inner peace amidst all the chaos: corrupted economy system, huge income disparity, poverty, food security, toxins, global warming, animal cruelty and countless other issues like that.

<strong>Because all I want in this life is to stay anchor in order to make a positive impact on the tide of events, no matter how miniscule my efforts are.</strong>

Some people tell me that this is how the world is and it is too late to change anything now. Even if that is the case, it doesn't mean I should just sit around, put blinkers and focus solely on my desires. What would yoga be if it did not bring us to be more aware of the surroundings we are in, to be conscious of our actions that we made daily, to live mindfully and to be more connected to our environment? In which if we look through the grandiosity of such events, we would then open ourselves, inspire the humility in us and slowly awaken ourselves to a possibility of a full on living, to live in the moment.
<h2>Being in the moment</h2>
<strong>Living in the moment is more about living in awareness and love.</strong> Some would call this love compassion, generousity, gratitude or kindness etc. It is the kind of love that gives and does not get itself attached to expectations. When we experience such love in this short lifetime of ours, we try to tread the Earth as softly as we could.

The world needs us to love, needs us to protect the remaining treasures: the birds, the sea, the swamps, the chimps, the gorilla, the sharks, the turtles, the mountains, the historical monument, the towns and all the interdependences of everything big and small. Because the world, currently at its epitome of connectedness need us more than ever to tear the barriers and past beliefs that no longer serve us to live as a better being.

We need to reconnect, to recognise that we are part of a whole and that we are too whole. To sum up, my yoga is not so much about what I do on the mat, not on how well I could prove my worth through the Yoga Sutras to rebut the behaviour of another and not on propagating how righteous and pure I am.

My yoga is about undertaking continuous self-reflection and being aware of the actions of my daily living. It is to bring about a mirror before myself and recognise that I am whole and never any less despite of what I am told and all the stupid things that I still do. I have all that I need to live this life well. Although, frankly speaking, I could use a little more cash in hand.
<h2><strong>The practice of imperfections</strong></h2>
Because Yoga also makes me realise the vulnerabilities of being alive. No matter what stage of development we are at, we will always live under natural laws and these natural laws state that all of us would one day decay. I accept myself regardless of my flaws and misgivings. But I will try, and I try harder each day to be a better human being. Ultimately, I know that I come from a complete whole.

Today, through the inner strength of pillar that yoga has shown me, I live in humility, peace and gratitude. Because just for today and every other todays, I am enough.

<strong>And this is my Yoga</strong>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Yoga Outdoors: Freeing The Boundaries</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/yoga-outdoors-freeing-the-boundaries/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Sun. Green. Birds. Breeze. Yoga.</em>
<h2><strong>Yoga outdoors</strong></h2>
We begin by standing barefooted feeling the uneven ground, freeing the receptors of our feet to feel the nuances of the Earth.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, we believe that there are many meridian points on our feet that connect to the rest of the body. We could map out our internal organs like brains, eyes, lungs, livers, pineal glands all on our feet. An Ayurveda advocate once tells me that somebody improves her myopic condition by messaging sesame oil on her feet every night.

By doing yoga outdoors, feeling the grass, separated from the Earth only by a yoga mat, I hope to bring about a similar effect. We use our body weights and the uneven terrain to apply a gentle pressure to these receptors. We make an intention to ground our feet by standing firmly with our weights evenly distributed on the balls and the heels.

<em>Ground. Feet. Soil. Grass.</em>

Through a series of movements with intention, we connect with the environment as much as we try to connect our breath with our movements.

Feel the connection to the ground, feel the insect that lands on your legs, feel the rough patches beneath. These all serve as a reminder of the work of the Universe. You are here, you are on a ground, you are one on the Earth, that bears a gazillion life forms, you are so small yet so connected. And let this theme resonates throughout the different facets of your life.
<h2><strong>Aware</strong></h2>
Firstly, you become aware of the funny sensation of your feet, the different points of your feet, the different sensation that you could feel on your feet.

Secondly, you start to improve your balance. Balancing on an unfamiliar terrain is not so easy, especially when it is not an even ground. Once, I meet a guy in Bali who could balance on one leg on a buttress root, which is at least 30 cm off the ground. He moves himself carefully up the root and as he reaches the height, where the surface becomes narrowly flat, almost a cylindrical shape, he turns towards me and balances into a tree pose, staying in the position as if he is an extension of the root. It takes practice and focus.

This brings us to the third point: patience. You become aware of your impatience and exasperation of not maintaining balance. And you realize that such a feeling is not serving you. So burn it, burn the feeling into something positive, maybe a drive to strike a balance and poise in your postures. Let this feeling extend and spread in your life, like a tree that grows strong from its center and from the ground.

<em>Balance. Peace. Harmony.</em>

Birds, at the background. Vehicles, rumble by at different speed and sound. We, suitably tucked under the shade of the trees.

Wind, bird, human and vehicle all come together to be open to the symphony of life.

Because I learn that man can coexist with nature. We are nature. For a long time, we have been trying to separate man and nature just as we have been trying to indulge in the mind-body dualism. Man is nature. And our mind and body are connected. In my class, I want to rediscover this harmony. There is no need to go into the camps of the extremes. But I too can’t object for people who decide to be in the extremity, as long as they find their home in there.
<h2>Symphony</h2>
<strong>This is how I yoga into harmony, or harmony into yoga.</strong>

It doesn’t matter which is which. The most important thing is to feel the connections and the peace taking place in different levels.

The connection of the ground and our feet, the movement and our awareness. As our practices progress, the separation of the ground and the feet becomes blur as we become more sensitive to the sensations on our feet. As with the external level, so too it will occur on the internal level.

The connection between the teacher and student fuses, the teacher is guiding but similarly, the student is imparting the wisdom of the body to the teacher. At that moment, it is no longer important who plays the role of the teacher or the student as all will ultimately fall into where they need to be.

<em>Reflect. Insight.</em>
<h2>One</h2>
Then when all the intentional movements end, when it comes to the silent introspective part of the practice, when we are no longer focus on the transition of various postures, when we finally remain still, the elements become louder.

We relax and calm our mind and we become more aware. We feel ourselves, feel the ground, feel the boundaries of our body, and maybe, we get a sneak peek to how all these boundaries essentially exist and don’t exist.

It is solid and it melts down but it stays solid.

We become non-existent yet expansive. We become one and we become all. We live and float and sing and dance and remain still, all at once. Life is a cordial paradox once we learn to sail and anchor in it. Life becomes effort and ease. Life becomes this important thing that you don’t necessary have to explain but only need to be in.

Outdoors. Breathe. Me. You. All. Everything. Nothing. For life becomes life.

<em>Shanti.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>2014. March 22.
</em>You left.
Traces of you wisping, like ghosts of soulless.
Our memories fragmented and diminished,
with no reminders of its' credibility.
Right before my eyes,
The places you’ve been,
the things you’ve once did. We all did.
And those damn words, all flooded by tears.
Lover, oh lover.

<em>2012. October 1.
</em>Of all the strangers who are passing by, how did lovers cross paths?
Thing could only get stranger when the funny chemical reaction from
oxytocin, they called the love hormone, accelerates.
To a path of happily ever after. Or a make believe so.
I wish to credit science for all that have been, to detach and see
as a scientist would to her subjects.
But I am a poet, an accursed one at that.

This is our love story. Love, fight, misery, and joy.
Two curve paths on their individual trajectory, crossing and separating.
Separating, and moving further away. Only to cross again.
This is how we begin, with an end in mind.
We have our hearts tinkling in this country of desperation.
Cries of ours to break the bondage of such land,
of such isolated community, of such anonymous being.
Unheard and unknown.

We couldn’t stay for long. I didn’t want to. And you never could.
I have the end in mind in the beginning. Maybe so it is for you too.

<em>2014. May 11.
</em>I’m chasing the tail of the last existence
of you in my world,
to know that you are still waiting for us, again.
I want to think so.
Those mystical creatures we could imagine. We
go spiraling freely in the tones of music.
I still dance without you, but recently find myself bound
to melodies of sorrow.

<em>Towards the infinity of time.</em>
Drum beats, churning the heart that flutters.
Our lives,
we have to find our home.
Yours, of grounding steady beats, of foot stamping,
of dances tribal.
Mine, of upbeats, of hips spinning, supposedly.
But it has become mellow and emotional,
of dances tribal.
Everything so tribal that it starts breaking apart in this land of agony,
speed and haste that we could never get along with.
A secret you remain and fine it will be.

<em>Today. Now. </em>I still miss you.
Still do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She chants and maybe meditates
a little
eighty of age.
Views of friends come and go.

The youths are admirable.
Come and go
to work, to dream, to the infinite.

Look at the cars, she says,
it gets really crowded on weekend.

She stands at the window
then she sits, chanting in a language I couldn’t understand,
praying for the day she
would be release.
Fear.
To go and never come back.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span class="userContent">3rd week as a job seeker.</span></h2>
<span class="userContent">I’m trying to find a job, any job that could get me through the next six months. I want to pay my school debts and the money that I owe my parents. I want to be debt free, so that I could finally pursue my dreams relentlessly. So during this period, I actively seek out employment, sending resume after resume to jobs that I would originally not have given a damn for. Hours spend <span class="text_exposed_show">looking and scrolling through the job placements, hoping to get one that will fit. No experience required but will be able to get me $8/hour. Yes, I’m 24, 4 years after graduation and still earning an hourly pay. And I’m not ashamed. Judge all you may, I have reasons for my doing.</span></span>

That day, the agent calls, "so what have you been doing these 4 years?"

<span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show">She has received my resume, she knew what I’ve been doing all along.</span></span>

But I answer her confidently, trying to hide my jittery, “Well, I work in the zoo as a show presenter, spend 7 months in New Zealand for working holiday, work in a pet grooming shop, after that it’s mostly F&amp;B. Mostly hands-on stuffs.”

Her voice comes from the other side of the phone, “I understand”.
<h2>It sounds so far away.</h2>
But what does she really understand? What does she mean by she understand? What is in her mind? But it’s not about her, it’s about me. How could I answer her question? How could I tell her that I have been broken and spend 4 years trying to get myself fixed? How could I tell her that I felt all the agony about being enslaved by corporations and am living the way that I am currently by hiding under the slogan of living my dream? How could I tell her that I feel so much every day that I couldn’t bear to see my life spending, not empowering others – even though I haven’t entirely done too much? How could I tell her that I’m still trying to piece myself together? How could I tell her that my eyes are tearing up from writing all these? How could she ever understand?

How could anyone ever understand? When all they see is someone optimistic, someone who is always smiling. Someone even asks me once, how is it that I’m always happy. And I always tell them the truth, because nobody is around when I’m upset. Nobody sees my struggles. Nobody wants to plunge into my darkness and drape his/her hands around me.
<h2>Nobody understands, not even me.</h2>
From young, I’m taught not to cry. I’m taught to stop all these nonsense. Slowly, I learn to recede into my shell, the highly-polished strong and fiery me. That’s not me. That’s not who I am. And who am I? Would you know? Would I know? For the four years, what have I done? I don’t know, but I know it is necessity. It is whatever it takes to keep my heart alive, to know what living is.

Because there is a side that nobody knows about living in such wilderness. A side that people living in such a way don't want to talk about. People like me, we live almost like a drug addict, constantly hook to the high of life. I have to live behind the adornment of being motivational, of being brave, of knowing exactly what I want. But the truth is, I didn’t know what I want until now. The judgments and the spiteful comments, they hold certain rights. The disdain and the exploitation, they show how stupid I could be. But still, I enjoy every bits of living in my skin, of busking in the false glorification from others about me being brave enough to take risks.

<span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show">Years before, someone told me that I would make it because I have the passion. Years after, my mum tells me that I could never succeed with all my flittering from dreams to dreams. Initially, it’s a writer, then somebody in the pet industry, then a yoga teacher, now to be a tribal fusion belly dancer. I have done it, and at the same time, never really achieved it.</span></span>
<h2>I am addicted.</h2>
To all the future glories even if they are lies I use to cover up my sporadic behavior. Who knows what could really happen in future?

Today, I lie on my bed, still broken but open. Open to the truth, open to the fortunes that I have, open to the opportunities that have been bestowed again and again, almost miraculously. And things start to make sense. I’m still piecing myself back but I know, I’m right on track. I have never been off it. I make mistakes, but I have never been where I don’t need to be.

And this is me. I’ll always be. Without shame.

I’ll always live wide awake. I'll live through the sufferings and the miseries.

<span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show">And I'll be. </span></span>
<h2><span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show">Real. </span></span></h2>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thump, thump, thump.
Drop, drop, drop.
Step, step, spin. Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder.
Hips push and maya.
Be a serpentine, belly rolls, undulations.

Common language that the belly dancers speak,
in motions and beats.
Energy flowing through, from our soul to our limbs.
Electrifying from the beats,
like a puppet on the string.
Pinocchio finds a way, to make his wish come true,
free to roam and test the boundaries.

The magic comes when the music plays,
as if our body are made from fixtures
individualised.
Muscles seemingly separate from the next,
but still moving in harmony.
To tell a story perhaps, to show emotions,
or simply to express the creative self.

Donned in bra and skirt,
with accessories down the arms
and neck. A moment on stage,
this is when we are set ablaze.
Mark of my soul,
into eternity, entwining
with the beats.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh, lovely twenty four,
what a pretty face you have.
But for what it's worth,
do you have the slightest clue?
With dreams beyond current means,
you speak with such naivety.
Love unbound.

You go on reasoning.
All should be set for great destiny,
but most choose to reject change.
They have set off so, to succumb.
Isn't there a famous saying,
“Many people die at twenty five,
and aren't buried
until they are seventy five”?

Actions fuel with desire,
like a baseball onwards homerun.
Far beyond, as all hold their breath.
Still on the field, scores are always running.
Maybe this will be the big strike,
more than a tie, towards a win, a trophy perhaps.

This twenty four, will she ever learn to win?
Dreams and persistence keeping her alive.
But funnily, she never feel hungry for success,
a bit too less for her circumstance.
Is that why she is sinking?
Still, happy, almost her only motive,
disregarding disdain.
Isn’t life purpose to be happy?
To be free, truly free?
Every day, messages and ideas
of extremities mix. Would we ever find a certain cure
for such obsessive sword fight of the mind?
Would people few hundred years later, laugh at us for our
desire of fatalities
as we busy ourselves to dust.

Like the iron curtain,
we all try to escape from such tyranny.
Hear us in agony. Escape, escape.
Every day, plot and dream.
But most of us do is only scream.

Young and idealistic, maybe,
dreams are not so far beyond,
not segregated by tough invisibility.
Obstacles, it is, to split opportunity seekers from the die-hard,
merely so.

The only thing to change is 'I'.
And perhaps from there, from all this being
of soul radiance, people feel the vibrations
and start climbing the wall,
not beyond their means,
regardless fears.

Go forth, warrior, for the fight of life and living.
Win.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you hear of the story of the woman who just would not?
The lies she sleeps upon,
like they are worthy to keep her warm.

The sinister hides in that gentle voice.
Oh, a handsome young boy he is,
I almost, also, did fall for his trickery.

But he,
the heart that never yearns for a queen,
wouldn’t place value in my temple of dreams.

But she, the woman insists to believe
that it’s my plain jealousy.
He comes to give her the comfort and the promise of eternity.
Only for her, he will change and stay.

She overtly pins, indicating to him,
even though
there is no surprise and no goodbye kiss.

The same story over and over too many time.
Departure, arrival, departure, departure.
A lie she wraps herself in, woven in sheep’s skin,
thoroughly through and true
in her ears.

No promises are given,
words are withheld.
his way of being.

She should have known.
A scarecrow with a heart of straw.
Initially so intimidated, she withdraws.

Circling, rounding things up.
Attractively enough, the edge on being devour.
Then, she perches on the hat.

Fearless. I’m fearless, he says.
Come.
She smiles, combing through his hair,
and bringing him close to her lips.

He trembles on the mention of a promise,
even without legs, he wouldn’t keep.
For the scarecrow is but with a heart of straw.

And I never hear of her anymore.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Let&#039;s Be An Artist Now</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>For this moment, sit alone.</h2>
Allow the buzz of the world to pass and listen closely to your heart’s desire. Perhaps, you would hear this voice inside of you. This voice is urging you shyly, slowly but surely, like a tortoise emerging from its’ shell. It could be so soft that it is almost inaudible to you, because you have never given it too much attention. But give it a little more time, you would hear that this voice in you is crying out for you to play, to play boundlessly and freely. It wishes for you to celebrate the moment and simply live in the now.

If you are patient to realize, you hear that this voice is nurturing an artist. Not the hot shot mega million rock star kind of artist, but the artist who is approachable, the artist, who is someone real, someone like you. There is an artist in you waiting to emerge if only you believe.
<h2><strong>We are all born to create. </strong></h2>
We spend much of our childhood imagining that we are captains sailing the ferocious sea, the jungle explorers stumbling on the next miracle herb for mankind, or even the sages working to solve the puzzle of the grand web of life. Of course, we might have one or two teddy bears which we would do voice over for. And we host our own kids’ entertainment channel, on par with Teletubbies and Blue Clues.
<h2>The world is full of possibilities and magic.</h2>
Then, we go to school where creating become mandatory, more than that, creativity becomes a chore and is stuffed into a box of grades and criticism. At the same time, we have to manage living in the cauldron of grades, expectations, mini-skirts, and the funny feeling towards the opposite sex. Bit by bit, we lose that little connection with simply making things up.

There, I say it, creating art isn’t anything noble, it isn’t all about creating The Last Supper, Mona Lisa or David. Yes, it could become something recognized, but art, strips to its’ base, is just making things up.
<h2>Art is play.</h2>
<strong>The word play is defiant, it rejects fitting into a singular form. </strong>

Play could involve legos, words, bodily movements, colors, flowers, cars, papers, photos, aubergines, chickpeas, knives, seedlings and so much more. Play would involve destruction and creation, no matter which form it takes. Even writers have to continuously depart with words they love. Art is a micro version of nature, the constant cycle of destruction and creation. Perhaps it is this reason why one could feel so much alive and at one with the universe when creating art. Some would call this experience being in the flow. Whatever you call it, it is real and so real that sometimes everything else becomes an illusion.

<strong>When you create art, you chuck the ominous question of the purpose of one’s existence to one side. </strong>

You could leave that to the philosophers to figure and argue among them for now. At this moment, when you are at one with your art, your soul resonates with the rhythm of the universe. And it is particularly in this state that you understand that this is all that you need.
<h2>All the layers of crises fall apart and cease to exist.</h2>
Others might ask if this is your form of escapade from the reality. And perhaps, this is the time to retrieve the question on the purpose of one existence and to question reality. What is reality exactly? Is it this environment of sterility and control whereby your every action could be spied by a particular person? Is it reality where you have to be living under surveillance and thronging among the crowd anonymously? Is this what is to be perceived as reality? The subject of reality is as broad as play could be, so why would one shackle another on the threat of reality?

<strong>So please don’t let the voices of others drown the timid voice in you.</strong>

You could be a dancer feeling the vibrations of music in our limbs, or a poet riding the tempo of words, or a photographer capturing the light of fleeting nature into eternity. This you could all be and even more in your life. You could be a low-wage worker, a farmer, a white collar, a top-level executive or a medical doctor. Whatever it is, you need not be in constant conflict with the voice crying out to create art. Because art transcends the boundaries of identities and labels. And through art, you would discover that you have lost yourself only to ultimately reconnect with the universe once more.
<h2><strong>Only if you listen to that timid voice inside you.</strong></h2>
<strong>Only if you take the courage to step in faith.</strong>

Then, through many cycles of construction, destruction, agony, happiness, emptiness, contentment, separation, unity and transcending, your world could never be the same again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What Goes On When I Compete As A Bellydancer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[7th July 2014, Thursday. Time, 4pm.

"And the next contestant, number twenty two, Puah Hui Ying."

<span class="text_exposed_show">I have to forget the pain in my knees. I never have that pain before, it happens only when I'm standing on the steps at the side of the stage. I could feel my heartbeat, faster than the drums beat playing through the sound system. The cliches of life all living in my cells right now. But I have to do it, I'm already here. A nod to the DJ and my song plays at the atrium of Far East Plaza.</span>
<h2>Belly dance competition</h2>
<em>Focus. Wait for the beat. Smile, shoulder shimmy, strut in to the middle of the stage.</em>

The tips of my lips freezes perpetually upwards. Or rather, as my friend would point it out, the most fake smile he has seen from me. During the dance, sometimes I got off-beats. But the same smile remains. At some point, I am sprinting across the beats, dancing to compete to the finishing line with the music. But the music is not interested in competing in my silly race.
<span class="text_exposed_show">
As the music goes, I slip somewhere in between the consciousness of enjoying myself and feeling nervous. Apparently, this effect goes into my wrists, as they flip around like it's broken, forming a chicken wing like shape. I am aware of my movements but I lose sense of some parts of my body.</span>
<h2>Only now</h2>
This is the moment when I am not one, I become more than one. I am the dancer who is competing with the beats. I am the dancer who looks drunk. I am the dancer who is enjoying herself. I am the dancer who dances not to compete with others but to enjoy herself.

<span class="text_exposed_show">1 minute 40 second, the music is inside of me. </span>I make up the steps towards the end of the show.

<span class="text_exposed_show"><em>Shimmy, step, step, spin, shimmy. </em>
</span>

<span class="text_exposed_show">2 minute 58 second, I end my dance two second before the song ends. I hold my pose awkwardly as the audience hesitate to clap. 3 minute, the song end. </span>
<h2><span class="text_exposed_show">Applause</span></h2>
<span class="text_exposed_show">I finish my piece, or my song finish me, I cannot really tell the difference. Gawkiness takes over, I forget to bow and speed down the stage. This is how my first solo performance end.</span>

But my journey of dance is just beginning. Now, I know clearly that I love dance. I love to perform dance. I want to spread the positive vibes and joys of dance. I want people to feel the connection around them, the connection of simplicity, gratitude and passion.

Things will only get better from now on. I will dance on, bringing arts to life.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>4 Benefits You Get From Private Yoga Sessions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Traditionally, yoga is shared between one teacher and one student. It is only in the recent development of yoga that group classes start popping up. In the age of spirituality meets capitalism, yoga has a face lift. It is now a slimming program, a butt and legs sculpting, a workout and so on. Classes can hold up to 20 people and events/workshops include hundreds. In such event, we are instead focusing on the benefits that you can get from private yoga session.

You might feel that you are not learning what you want, or you might feel out of place in a room of ballerina-like flexible practitioners. However, interestingly enough, nowadays, yoga teaching is coming to a full circle as more and more teachers are offering private yoga classes.

&nbsp;
<h2>Not sure if private yoga classes are for you? Here are some reasons for you to consider one.</h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>4. You get a yoga practice personally tailor to your physique and needs.</strong></h2>
Feeling a little bit unfocused, or feeling you need more drive in your day? Through a private yoga practice, you could convey such feelings to the yoga teacher so as to work towards a sequence that will better prepare you for the events for the rest of the day. When working closely with a yoga teacher, you will also gain insights to how to sequence and tailor your practice according to your mental and physical conditions on that particular day.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>3. You learn the concept of movements.</strong></h2>
A good asana practice should correct structural alignment, build strength, improve flexibility, promote proper functioning of body system and mental steadiness. When you have the attention of a yoga teacher, a detailed explanation of movements and concepts are usually part of the teaching. From this, you will understand the functions (as mention above) of different asanas instead of just chasing their forms.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>2. You grow more in your practice. </strong></h2>
When a teacher is teaching in a group setting, he/she has to make sure that the class teachings are suitable for everyone. It might also be the case that you will not have the chance to clarify doubts on certain teachings of the teacher. You grow, not just in the sense of becoming more flexible or stronger, you are able to grasp the concept of applying your practice into daily living.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>1. You learn concepts and teachings that will help you to cope with the vicissitudes of life</strong>.</h2>
A group teaching is usually focused heavily on asanas practice. The asanas do help to calm the mind, improve concentration and raise awareness, but yoga is more than a physical exercise. Yoga, is a practice for you to discover a clarity of mind through the eight limbs. When you learn the tools of the eight limbs and adopt them to your daily living, you will discover the potential of yoga to positively transform yourself.

		<title>Be inspired To Practice? Do this 1 thing right now</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dance is the flawless marriage of aesthetic and athleticism. It is a representation of grace, strength, flexibility, pause, movement, silence, rhythm, joy, grieve and all the other bipolars in life. Dance is the explosion of magic in a short spur of time, usually perform within ten or fifteen minutes yet it couldn't be made possible without long hours of drill, practice, observation, choreographing, and more practice.

Throughout my course of study in dance, I've seen many previously passionate dancers give up dancing. Dance is physical work, and sometimes it could get hard, especially for people who have a tiring day job.
<h2>Be inspired to practice</h2>
But if you love dancing and want to keep on going, what is the one definite way that could keep you coming back to your dance practice, day after day? I'm not referring to going to class once a week, I'm talking about maintaining a self discipline of dance practices, at least three to four times a week.
<h2>The answer is simple: Have a goal in mind.</h2>
<h2><strong>What do you want to achieve through dance?</strong></h2>
Do you want to perform? To bring joy to others through your movements? To tell a story through tempo? To maintain your health? Or to meet amazing people who share the same interests as you?

Yes, you can dance because you enjoy it. But what would motivate you to practice more and to dance more is to have a <strong>clear, definite and measurable goal in mind</strong><strong>.</strong> Actually, this is the truth to motivate yourself to practice anything in your life.

When I first start dancing, I didn't take dancing too seriously. It is just something for me to occupy my time. But as time goes by, as I perform more, I discover that dance is going to be part of my life. I practice more often, take the initiative to seek out various techniques and teachings. And now, I want it to be part of my career, alongside my yoga teaching.
<h2><strong>So this is my progress: </strong></h2>
Initially, I dance because<em> I want to find something to occupy myself in my free time. </em>
Afterwards, I dance because <em>I want to do well in my performance. </em>
Subsequently, I dance because <em>I want to make people smile and make it part of my profession. </em>

Nevertheless, the most important reason throughout the different stages remains: because I love life, and dancing allows me to connect instantaneously with it.

As belly dancers, we shimmy. <strong>And sparkle. </strong>

<em>Below is a dance video of my first solo performance during July 2014, choreograph by my dance teacher. This is one of the milestone in my dancing that motivates me to practice harder everyday. One day, I hope to bring my own choreograph to stage. In the meantime, I hope you will enjoy this mini performance. </em>

		<title>Motivation 101: SMART steps to fulfill your dance dream</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/motivation-101-smart-steps-to-fulfill-your-dance-dream/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Previously, we talk about <a title="The 1 Definite Way to Motivate Yourself To Practice" href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/the-1-definite-way-to-be-inspired-practice/" target="_blank">setting goals</a> to keep yourself motivated in dancing. I know many people who set New Year's resolution with enthusiasm only to forget about it when February comes. How many of us actually follow through our goals? What is the secret to achieve our dreams? Are people who reach their goals more talented or with more willpower? Maybe or maybe not. I have seen brilliant people falling off their tracks and the "average Joe" making it.

There is a right way to set goals, that is to do it SMART. Forget about sweeping your dreams as the days pass, employing SMART steps will make sure you commit to your goals.
<h2><strong>SMART steps are Specific, Milestone, Attainable, Relevant or Realistic, and Timely.  </strong></h2>
We will look into each of them in details.
<h2><strong>1. Specific</strong></h2>
Vague goals cause you to procrastinate because you don't have a clear and feasible direction. If you set vague goals, chances are that it will be a big pie to chew off, causing you to feel a little paralysed by the goal itself.

So set specific goal, break your steps down into actionable goals by applying the “What &amp; How” And feel free to throw in the other “W” – “Who, When, Where, Why” for even more specific goal. The key is to write something down that you know you could focus and work on. The way to write a specific goal is to ask yourself how till you could no longer answer it.

Take for example, you are practicing a choreograph for a performance. You record the dance and spot that there certain segments of the dance that you wish to improve.

Initially, you might write something vague: Improve my dance

<em>(how?)</em>

Improve my shimmy

<em>(how?) </em>

Strengthening my quads

<em>(how?)</em>

Quads training once a week for 20 minutes a day (Specific and actionable goal)

A specific goal will look something like this:

(Segment of dance: 0:25-0:40) Improve shimmy by strengthening my quads through quads training once a week for 20 minutes.

(1:12-1:150) Be more graceful with my hands by studying ballerinas. Watch XXX, pause and rewind to study frame by frame if necessary.

Be detailed. Know where you are going, draw a clear road map for yourself and you will minimise the chances of losing track.
<h2><strong>2. Milestone</strong></h2>
The original acronym in this is actually measurable, but milestone fits better in our context.

&nbsp;

Just as you won't expect yourself to become professional with your first class, don't jump from taking your first dance lesson to teaching. Remember what we talk about in the first point? Be specific and detailed.

Keep a milestone journal. Record what you have achieve and how far you have journeyed with your dance. This helps you tremendously especially when you feel tired and wish to give up. Looking at your milestone journal enables you to relive your past joy and initial motivation. This will give you a better vantage point to decide your next step.
<h2><strong>3. Attainable</strong></h2>
You can have your biggest dream in regards to your dance journey. By all means, set your dreams as far as becoming the next belly dance poster girl, like Rachel Brice. I always believe in dreaming big. Because if you do so, at least if you fail to reach your dream, hopefully you are nowhere to far away from it. However, it is imperative to set small milestone or goals that are attainable to you, wherever you are right now. If you just begin belly dancing, don’t set your view on international stage. That will be where you want to progress to, but set something more attainable to you at this moment, e.g. performing at your local club, gathering, friend’s wedding etc.

Once you attain the short-term goal, you feel good. As human beings, we seek pleasure. So if you are on your right path to fulfilling your dance dreams, you will be chasing after your next attainable dance related goal. In contrary, if you tend to set high goals without interspersing it with any short-term goals, you are setting yourself up for continuous feeling of drawbacks and failures. It's like asking yourself to climb the Mount Everest the next day when you have been a couch potato all your life. Get the idea?
<h2><strong>4. Realistic/ Relevant</strong></h2>
Some people will never be able to do splits in their life. I know I can’t. Some people will never be able to do a layback due to their back injury. It is important to understand the limitations of your body when dancing. While you could increase your range of motion over time, just take caution not to injure your hamstring or pelvic region. If not, your dance lifespan will be cut even shorter. What’s important is not to do what look good on others. In comparison to other genres of dancers, as belly dancers, we are given a lot of freedom to express ourselves. So instead of blindly copying others strength, explore yours and craft a style of your own. One way to do it is by taking part in performance and competition, you can't escape from the deadline.
<h2><strong>5. Timely</strong></h2>
Set a timeline for yourself. When it comes to dancing, the lifespan of you being a dancer is very short-lived, unless you plan only to dance for leisure. Most dancers, except for the ultra-talented, have to face the cruel fact that they will be replaced by younger, more beautiful, more skilled dancers. Sometimes, cruelly, all 3 of them could be found in one individual. So, set a timeline for yourself, feel the urgency to achieve your goals. You will be surprised how resilient and how skilful you could get if you are under a bit of healthy timeline stress.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nowadays, yoga is associated with many different things. If you search anything and yoga on google, it is highly likely to fetch some results for you.

Here are some interesting Google statistics:
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Toilet yoga: 15,700,000 results
Teletubbies yoga: 3,060,000 results
Yoga with dinosaur: 817,000 results
Dubstep yoga: 544,000 results
Sailor Moon yoga: 519,000 results
Pink panther yoga: 470,000 results
Yoga toothbrush holder: 304,000 results</p>
As you can see, a lot of people are talking about yoga, even with things that are unrelated with yoga. Teletubbies. Pink Panther. Sailor Moon. I'm sure a search on Pikachu Yoga will fetch some interesting results too. With so many people talking, rumors and myths about yoga start to spread. Some are acceptably reasonable concerns but others are just down right ridiculous.
<h2>Yoga myths</h2>
Here are 27 of them, starting with the appetizers.
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>1. I can’t do yoga, I am not flexible enough</strong>
Even more, you should start practicing some asanas to loosen those muscles.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>2. Yoga is a slimming regimen</strong>
Maybe you will slim down, maybe not. Being fat is a complex physiological response which has no magic bullet solution.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>3. Yoga cures</strong>
Yoga doesn’t cure you of your depression or whatsoever, but it helps in the process of healing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>4. Yoga helps you to sweat out toxins</strong>
Great, we are throwing the science of detoxing through lungs, livers and kidneys out of the real world hur?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>5. Yoga is a girly thing, real men don’t do yoga</strong>
Real men change light bulbs, are the breadwinner, don’t cry, don’t show too much emotions, blah, blah, blah. Are we not done with the stereotyping of men?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>6. If one hour of yoga asana is good for you, then three hours must be good. Oh wait, make it five</strong>
Ah, all that time sending light all over your body must be pure bliss.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>7. The perfect forms of the asanas and you will get it one day</strong>
Our body structures are all different. We should adapt the asanas to fit our body and not the other way round.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>8. You have to practice a fix set of asanas</strong>
Read note #7, I’m not repeating myself.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>9. Even if it is purely physical, it is still yoga. Isn’t yogalympics a thing nowadays?</strong>
Judge not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>10. Allow your heart to blossom in your practice</strong>
Do you want to see the lotus in front of my chest?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>11. Backbends will help you to open your heart</strong>
Open your heart, let your blood gush out and decorate the class with a shimmering part of your every being.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>12. You have to clear your nose with a neti pot</strong>
The only thing I clean my nose with is a tissue and my forefinger.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>13. You have to wear yoga tights to yoga class</strong>
Well, fair enough, just no sheer tights, please.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>14. Mala beads look cool on yoga practitioners</strong>
No. Do you even know what they mean?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>15. Lululemon and Double Buddhasana is the sign that you have reach the highest form of yoga</strong>
Mmm. That’s a sign of fat wallet and flexible limbs to me. No more, no less.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>16. That a highest form of yoga exist</strong>
Samadhi? Maybe, but I never meet anyone who said they have been there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong> 17. Padmasana is the way to sit in order to gain enlightenment</strong>
Yes, by numbing all your nerves and transporting you into another realm call A&amp;E.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>18. Yoga is a religion, and my religion tells me not to believe in other religion</strong>
Yoga is not a religion. I am an atheist and my atheism tells me not to believe in other religion too. High 5!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>19. Going into animal postures is evil</strong>
So is swimming frog style and practicing chinese martial art. Oh wait, have you seen the trailer of Alice in Wonderland by The Royal Opera House?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>20. You will be possess by the evil snake spirit if you practice yoga</strong>
“Ssss SsHHHH sssszzzz”, that’s me trying to communicate with my snake spirit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>21. And you will start wriggling like a snake</strong>
A;lfhd oaehroefajs ;fl f, oh sorry, I was just wriggling  adfsadfq dfat adf on my adf atrgf  afda  keyboard.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>22. Once you practice yoga, you start seeing energy forms around you</strong>
Have you not seen the light?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>23. Your internal system and being will light up through yoga</strong>
Jingle bells, jingle bell, enlightenment is on the way. Oh what joy, it is to be an enlightened Christmas Tree.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>24. We are going to spend all day talking about energy, beings or energy beings</strong>
The fundamental of energy is that it can be converted in forms, but not created or destroyed. Ok, let's move on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>25. All yoga teachers can do headstand and put their legs behind their head</strong>
Prepare a stretcher for me while I do this, I might just get stuck and need to be pried open.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>26. Yoga teachers are all balanced human beings and can really hold their sh*t together</strong>
We are still human, and as human, we screw up from time to time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>27. That there will ever be a comprehensive list to tell you how to be a good yoga practitioner</strong>
Now, go live your life to the best of your abilities and spread the love and goodness in you.</p>

		<title>5 lessons from Pablo Picasso to bring your belly dance skills to the next level</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pablo Picasso was unarguably one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Even those who are not in the art scene have, most probably, heard of his name. He was an art radical who revolutionized modern art, pioneered Cubism and made contributions to Symbolism and Surrealism. He was a prolific genius who could not be contained by a single medium – he was a painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright. It is estimated that he produced 50,000 pieces of art which include paintings, sculptures, ceramics, drawings, prints, tapestries and rugs during his career. He also produced several multimillion paintings and his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar%C3%A7on_%C3%A0_la_pipe" target="_blank">Boy With A Pipe</a> was sold at $117.6 million in 2004.

While I’m not sure how many multimillion dancers the world could realistically produce, we could all learn from this great master on how we could carve a niche of our own.
<h2><strong>1. Define your character, theme and/or style</strong></h2>
Picasso’s career could be broken into a few periods: Blue Period, Rose Period, Cubism, Classical Period, Surrealism and His Late Work. In each period, the paintings are defined by a distinct element, e.g. painting in Blue Period is dominated by blue and Rose Period, by warmer colors.

As artists, our works keep evolving to reflect our current life stage, or maybe even our obsession. Nowadays, people are fusing belly dance and other forms of dance, tango, flamenco, hip hop, popping etc. As belly dancers, we are given the liberty to play and experiment with different styles. Be bold, be Picasso-like in defining your own style and body language. Identify the theme and style behind your piece and build your dance to it, e.g, do you want a pretty dance, a happy dance, a graceful dance, a sad dance or a transition of emotions?
<h2><strong>2. Understand your tools: space, shapes, colors, lines and techniques</strong></h2>
When Picasso worked with different mediums, he knew the nature of his medium. He was also heavily involved in the printmaking process. He had to understand the different techniques of print making, the emotional and visual impact of color, the process of layering colors and the manipulation of shapes, especially in his cubism period.

When you start to look into the details of your dance, the lines and shapes you create, you transform your dance to the next level instantly. Even a tilt in the head helps to portray a different mood. As dancers, we have the stage as our canvas. Through the detailed study of our movement: the lines, shapes and techniques that give structure to our performance; we could heighten the impact of our dance.
<h2>3. Know the rules well but break them if you deem fit</h2>
When Picasso was in the arts school during his teen, he was frustrated on the school’s focus and curriculum and skipped classes to roam the streets and sketched on his own. When he cofounded cubism, which forms are analyzed, broken down and reconstructed in geometric shapes, he had initiated a style, that had never been done in the art world. Cubism forms the basis for many future art developments, e.g. abstract.

We are given the liberty to lose ourselves in the depth of creativity. We are all rebels; we could deconstruct dance steps, combine it and present it in a form that has never been seen before. Picasso also employed polarizing themes, e.g. beauty and ugliness in an art piece. With belly dance, you could tell any story, even the ones that are out of the world, you could tell a story about fighting a tiger and about gods falling in love. Do not be afraid to experiment, play and push yourself through the boundaries, even if it means breaking a few traditional belly dance rules. You never know where you will go if you never try.
<h2>4. You might be known, you might be unknown, or you could be both. Regardless, move on</h2>
Even with Picasso's fame, he had many artworks that are less known. His African Period was little known. And given the prolificacy of Picasso, it is impossible for any one individual to hear of all his art work. He continued working even till his late eighties.

It is important for you to not be defeated by one failure or to be overly indulgent on past achievements. Keep moving on from projects to projects and constantly experiment with new ways of doing things. If you are at your lowest point, find something to make things work. If you are at your glorious moments, find a way to make things even better. These continual work, study, feedback and revision will make you a better performer.
<h2>5. You could, and most probably should, bring your emotions to work</h2>
Another thing that Picasso was famous for was his liaison with women. To him, women were either goddesses or door mats. He was married twice and had many girlfriends and affairs. Picasso, a 20th century Don Juan, managed to seduced woman almost a third of his age. They were his muse and inspirations. One of his most prized art work was Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, featuring his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter.

No, I’m not encouraging you to start affairs to fuel your art work. I am a proponent of monogamy, though I believe it will never be adopted by certain individuals. However, taking Picasso’s muse as an example, as an artist, you are at the liberty to allow your work to be inspired by the drama, tension, love and joy in your life. Indeed, some of the most significant dances might just be those that tell a story and leave an emotional imprint. There is probably no second occupation that allows you to be so emotional at work. This is your gift as an artist, so treasure it well and show the world you are capable of.

These are the lessons that I learn from Picasso. Do you find inspiration from other artists too? Share your thoughts at the comments section below.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[January, you make a long list of resolutions. In the first few weeks, everything looks good and you feel motivated. Then come February, things start to backslide. March, everything is back to the way it is before you make your resolutions. By the end of September, you forget most of the items on your New Year’s resolution list.
<h2>New Year resolutions don't work</h2>
Have you experience this before? If yes, you are not alone, <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/" target="_blank">92% of people are unsuccessful in achieving their resolution</a>.

3 possible reasons for this to occur are:
<ul>
<ul>
 	<li>You usually set unrealistic and vague goals.</li>
 	<li>You get a wrong cause and effect relationship on their goals. For example, you think that by changing a small aspect of their life, your entire life will be changed. And when that doesn’t happen, you revert back to your old behaviors.</li>
 	<li>You lack the proper structure to attain your goals, which comes from a change in the behaviors, which is fueled by a change in the mental processes.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
What can you do to change your live?

Here are 5 things for you to do right now to ignite your life in 2015.
<h2>1. Be honest and SMART</h2>
An unrealistic goal is defined as the projection of a state of being that is significantly unrealistic and out of alignment of your current situation. You paralyze yourself after a long sustained period of not being able to achieve your goals. Vague goals such as losing weight and getting organized (these 2 happen to be in the top 10 New Year Resolutions) do not help you to fare any better. They lack a course of actions and urgency. If you want your goals to stick in 2015, take effort to reevaluate your sense of reality and set your <a title="Motivation 101: SMART steps to fulfill your dance dream" href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/motivation-101-smart-steps-to-fulfill-your-dance-dream/" target="_blank">SMART (specific, milestone, attainable, realistic/relevant, timeline) goals</a>.
<h2>2. Practice gratitude and contentment</h2>
<div style="background-color: #ffff9e; padding: 5px; margin: 10px; text-align: left;">

<strong>From contentment unsurpassed happiness is gained. </strong><em>Yoga Sutra II.42</em>

It has been said in this connection: “The happiness gained on this earth through the enjoyment of desired objects, or the supreme heavenly joy, is not even one-sixteenth of the happiness caused by the cessation of desires.”     -- Yoga philosophy of Pantajali by Samkhya-yogacharya Swami Hariharananda Aranya

</div>
Positive emotions have the potential to motivate behaviors and actions that are essential to achieve our goals. Practicing gratitude and contentment will generate these positive emotions for you regardless of the circumstances of your life. In life, nothing is set in stone, things come and go. Sometimes, you gain, while other times, you lose. If you constantly focus on your loss, you will never be contented.

Here is one simple exercise for you to try out:
<ul>
 	<li>Reflect on the desired object you already have. It could be tangible, like your family, or intangible, like your knowledge of cooking.</li>
 	<li>Next, meditate or contemplate on the thought ‘What I have got is enough for me in this moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Learn to regulate your emotions through your breath</h2>
Having said so, sometimes you might not have the luxury or the mental clarity to do the simple meditation above. Or your mind is in such a high flux of emotions that it is just not receptive to the above practice. In this case, you could use your breathe to calm your mind. Our breathing patterns are closely related to our state of emotion being. When we are anxious and angry, our breathing become shallow. Whereas, when we are relaxed, we breathe deeper and slower. Studies have also found that regularly practicing breathing exercises lowers one’s level of cortisol — the “stress hormone.”

The next time you are feeling overwhelmed, turn your attention into your breathing by doing this:
<ul>
 	<li>Inhale while counting to 4 slowly.</li>
 	<li>Exhale while counting to 4 slowly.</li>
 	<li>Repeat until you feel calmer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Live a healthy lifestyle</h2>
A healthy lifestyle is the foundation for everything else in your life, be it work, relationship, studies or finance. You can’t motivate yourself when you are feeling lethargic all the time. And you can’t focus well if you are having issues with chronic pain.

Stretch, do yoga, dance, hike, run or whatever exercise you deem fit. Moderate your diet. Sleep early. Watch less TV. Spend more quality time with your friends and family.Take some time to nourish yourself.

You might not see the impact directly on your goals in the short term, especially if your goals are not health related, but you will definitely see the benefits in the long run.
<h2>5. Beware of indulging in distracting short term pleasure</h2>
While it is alright to reward yourself from time to time, beware of being indulgence. Indulgence might lead to attachment, which in turn could lead to a constant thirst of such pleasure. Much like an addict, when you are addicted to such short term pleasure, you might act involuntarily, unconsciously and uncontrollably towards the objects of pleasure.

There are good reasons why gluttony and greed are part of the seven deadly sins and why one of the three poisons in Buddhism is attachment. When you spend a huge portion of your time in indulging yourself, you have reduced the amount of quality time you could spend working towards your goals.

37. Every time I dance I turn into a better version of me. -- <em>Unknown</em>

47. [... Dance] involves every possible feeling (as potential), because it is of the body, which is lived (inescapably) as a body of feeling. Some of these feelings we can name, and some we cannot, since we associate feelings with language only when we name them. The body lives sentience on a preverbal level. Dance exists first on this primordial level, not on an intellectual plane (even though it requires skill and intelligence). Its inmost substance cannot be reasoned, only experienced.  ―<em> Sondra Horton Fraleigh</em>

48. As the sun began to rise, the man reached out to the woman, and they clasped hands. He cradled her, and languidly they lifted themselves up to their feet, their bodies brushing, their eyes lost in each other's. Sensuously, deliberately, they danced, moving as though they were one, their body language smooth as their limbs carefully unfolded. They twirled and rocked, intertwined and separated, nearly leaning onto one another but barely touching, their movements sometimes tender, sometimes almost violent...Moments passed while the dancers held tight to each other, as though their bodies were melting together. The expression on their features as they lifted their faces to the sky was one of unimaginable joy.  ― <em>Hannah Fielding</em>

49. Without any music, I started to dance. I wanted the music to be inside me, or at least for it to appear that way. I imagined myself the lead with an audience here to see me perform in a famous ballet. In my fantasy, there was no panic attack. I was free to dance. Free to be me.  ― <em>Lesa Howard</em>

50. The most essential thing in dance discipline is devotion, the steadfast and willing devotion to the labor that makes the classwork not a gymnastic hour and a half, or at the lowest level, a daily drudgery, but a devotion that allows the classroom discipline to become moments of dancing too.  -- <em>Merce Cunningham</em>

51. If you want to dance seriously, do. You must think about it day and night, dream about it, desire it.  -- <em>Christa Justus</em>

52. People tend to look at dancers like we are these little jewels, little cardboard cut-outs, and yet we have blood and guts and go through Hell.  -- <em>Susan Jaffe</em>

		<title>A Guide To Integrating The 8 Limbs of Yoga Into Your Life: Part 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Undeniably, this is the era of yoga. In USA, there are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/06/american-yoga_n_2251360.html" target="_blank">20.4 million adults</a> practicing yoga. There are <a href="http://www.yogadirectory.sg/studios.php#B" target="_blank">57 listed yoga studios </a>in Singapore. A search for yoga teachers in Singapore also yield an impressive list.

There is an ever growing niche of yoga – Anusara, Iyengar, Astanga, Power, Bikram, Hatha, Yin, Viniyoga, Kudalini, SUP and so on.
<h2>A holistic yoga practice</h2>
Essentially, yoga is just yoga. It is intriguing for there to be so many different yoga styles because the text, which gives structure to yoga, Yoga Sutras, only have 2 sutras committed on asanas. But nowadays, we have some practitioners talking about bakasana and headstand like that is the epitome of yoga. I agree that these postures are fun to do, but to me, what makes our yoga practice so beneficial to our life is the holistic package that it offers in the eight limbs. I encourage you to take the time to understand the philosophy of yoga, understand the eight limbs of yoga and practice them.

To get you started, here are the brief explanations of the eight limbs of yoga and a brief guide to integrating them into your life.
<h2><strong>Limb 1: Yamas.</strong> <strong>Restraints.</strong></h2>
The 5 restraints are non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, control of sexual desires and abstinence from coveting things.

These restraints are quite similar in any other ethics teaching. What goes around comes around. Even if there is no such thing as retribution in the world, we shouldn’t hurt others. If we hurt others, we can actually feel the pain of others as our own. Call me hippy, but I think we all have a responsibility to strive to spread more love and compassion in this unbalanced world. Watch this video to understand how doing good things could lead to a happy brain.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZZ0zpUQhBQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2><strong>Limb 2: Niyamas</strong>. <strong>Observances.</strong></h2>
The 3 observances are discipline (cleanliness, contentment and austerity), constant study and devotion/surrendering of your actions.

Again, I see all these niyamas as the fundamentals of life, no matter which aspects you apply them to, be it academic, work or activism.

Cleanliness applies to both physically and mentally. When we clean ourselves mentally, it means we rid ourselves of impurities like arrogance, malice and etc. Contentment and austerities guide us to live within the means that is required to sustain our lives.

We don’t get more than we need and we are able to develop resilience in our minds. In which, this determination and discipline will enable us to maintain regular study that add values to our lives.

Surrendering of our actions don’t mean giving up, it refers to devoting our actions for our higher self/God/greater good in a way that we become unattached to the results of our actions. We will do what is required of us to make this a better world but we will carry in ourselves a sense of peace no matter what our actions result.
<h2><strong>Limb 3: Asana. Physical postures.</strong></h2>
This is what most people know yoga for. The physical postures of yoga: the downward dog, upward dog, cobra, headstand and etc.

A good and sound practice of physical postures comes from the derivations of postures and sequencing according to the individual strength, flexibility and needs. When asanas are practice in such a way, it will increase our strength, improve our flexibility, improve our structural alignment, promote proper functioning of our body systems and maintain mental steadiness.
<h2><strong>Limb 4: Pranayama. Regulation of breath.</strong></h2>
The yogic breathing methods include various form of breathing, like ujjayi, nadishodhana and sitali. It also includes the practice of regulation and suspension of inhalation and exhalation.
<h3>Our breath hold the key to our mental state.</h3>
Recall the time when you are angry, or when you are peaceful, how is your breathing like? Chances will be when you are angry, you are inhaling heavily and quickly. When you are peaceful, your breath is deep and smooth.

If our minds are restless, our breath will also fluctuate greatly. It works the other way too.

If we try to concentrate on our breath, our mind becomes focus too. The practice of breath regulation helps to quiet our mind, improve our concentration and bring about a state of peace.

In our next article, we will continue to <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/a-guide-to-integrating-the-8-limbs-of-yoga-into-your-life-part-2/">explore the other 4 limbs</a>. These 4 limbs will guide us through the exploration of our mind in order to achieve a state of calmness and peace.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, we talk about the first 4 limbs of yoga: <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/a-guide-to-integrating-the-8-limbs-of-yoga-into-your-life/">yamas, niyamas, asana and pranayama</a>. These could be said to form the external or physical practices of yoga. Today, we are going to talk about the next 4 limbs, which are the internal or mind-based practices of yoga. There is no one limb that is more important than the other.
<h3>Implement the 8 limbs in a way that will be relevant to you.</h3>
For example, we might focus our efforts more on asanas when we are in our twenties, however this might transform to a practice that is more heavy on meditation or pranayama when we are in our forties. Let's take a look at the other four limbs of yoga.
<h2><strong>Limb 5: Pratyahara. Withholding of senses.</strong></h2>
Pratyahara is the state whereby our senses follow the nature of our mind. Senses in this context are not limited to our five senses, they also include the cognitive and physiological activities. It is the bridge that joins the physical practices to the inner practices of yoga. Pratyahara is like the action of the queen bee. If you try to move a queen bee from the original hive to another location, the worker bees will soon follow suit. Using this analogy, the queen bee is your mind and the worker bees are your sense.
<h3>Whatever you think of, your senses will follow suit.</h3>
There are various types of pratyahara. Being specific to yoga, we aim to regulate the fluctuations of the mind such that the senses will stop theirs. In our modern world, our senses are constantly stimulated by advertisements, internet, food and material objects. This could lead to an endless cycle of desires to pacify our senses. In satisfying these desires, we will momentarily quiet our mind. However through such methods of quieting our mind, we are creating a reward system for our mind to become attached to the pleasure of the senses and desire more. For example, our mind is thinking of a new bag, so we go out to purchase one. We are satisfied with our current purchase, but often such happiness is fleeting. After a while, our mind will start desiring for another new bag. And the cycle goes on.
<h3>In yoga, we practice pratyhara to master our senses.</h3>
This does not mean the practice of pratyahara will lead us to a cessation of all activities, but instead, it increases the awareness of the safe haven that we have deep within us. Within us, we hold the key to regulate our mind and change our behaviours. By becoming aware of how our mind causes us to make bad decisions, we could then take action to stop our mind from influencing our actions that will results in bad habits and addictions.
<h2><strong>Limb 6: Dharana. Fixity.</strong></h2>
This limb is described as having our mind fix on a particular object (external) or feeling (internal). In a less fanciful way of speaking, it means concentration on a particular object/feeling.

I like to see this limb as a flow from pratyahara. Once we stop ourselves from being pulled around by our senses, we could channel our concentration into this one particular thing of our choice.
<h3>How often do we get to sit still and focus on one object?</h3>
A lot of people like to pride themselves to be efficient multi-tasker. (Take home trivial: Neuroscience studies have shown that <a href="http://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx" target="_blank">multi-tasking is actually making us less efficient</a>.) How many browser tabs do you have right now? Is your email software notifying you of new mail every hour? Do you feel compel to switch from whatever you are doing to check this way too important, must-reply-in-5-minutes, email?

The dharana that we practice on our meditation chair or yoga mat could be applied to your daily life so as to improve the quality of our lives and efficiency.
<h2><strong>Limb 7: Dhyana. Meditation.</strong></h2>
In yoga, we actually have a clear definition for meditation. It means that you can achieve dharana in a continuous flow, like the flow of oil or honey.

I’m not trying to confuse you with the various definitions but these are the different stages of the internal practices of yoga. The main difference between fixity and meditation is their duration. In fixity, the concentration is intermittent while in meditation, it is continuous.
<h2><strong>Limb 8: Samadhi. Perfect concentration.</strong></h2>
If you have been practicing yoga for a while, you probably have heard of this, Samadhi.

Some called it enlightenment; some called it the highest limb of yoga. In the yoga sutras, this is defined as meditation to a state whereby only the object of meditation shines forth and the knowledge of self (the meditator) dissolves.
<h3>In contrary to popular belief, yoga does not have any teachings with regards to emptying your mind.</h3>
How do you empty your mind with a mind intent on emptying your mind? Who is the mind that minds the mind? The notion of emptying your mind is a cryptic hieroglyph that nobody will be able to solve.

Personally I like to see Samadhi as being parallel to being in the state of flow, whereby you and your object of concentration becomes one and that you become fully immerse in the object so much that you stop being self-conscious.

Psychologist, Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, puts this beautifully:
<div style="background-color: #ffff9e; padding: 5px; margin: 10px; text-align: left;">... being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost.</div>
<h2>Yoga is more than asanas.</h2>
The study and practice of all the 8 limbs of yoga helps us to live in a balance way and navigate through difficult times in our lives. We have finished our mini series of guide to integrating the 8 limbs into our life. Hopefully, you could apply a few points that we discuss into your life. <strong>If you do, let me know how it goes in the comment section below.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

Dancers are a special breed of people. We are trained artistically but not always scientifically. Some of us train for a long period of time without giving muscles the time to rest. This could result in a lot of imbalances and ailments. Improper postures and straining of the muscles are some of the common injuries. Once, I wake up with a pain on the side of my right feet. For the next two days I am limping in a bandage. This is probably caused by over usage of my feet. My work requires me to stand up for 8 hours and I practice dance and yoga at home. So you can imagine the considerable amount of stress on my feet. So I start researching into how I  can dance better without killing myself.
<h2>Enter food habits that could enhance dance perfomances</h2>
To dance well requires more than a knack for aesthetic, it should include core, strength, flexibility and stamina training. There is another one important aspect of dance practice, that is often neglected: our diet. Athletes and coaches know about the powerful connection of food with performance.

They know how food, being our fuel of energy, could help us to train better and perform better. Athletes involved in strenuous training often load up on their carbohydrates and eat a high energy diet. Somebody is there to teach them how to eat right. Sadly, this is something that is not talked about often in dancers.

I don’t know about you, but I find my dance training a mishmash of athletic and aesthetic training. So today I’m going to share with you 7 basic tips on proper nutrition for dancers, drawing on reference of an athletic's diet.
<h2>1. Don’t be afraid of high calories intake</h2>
As dancers, most of us are afraid of getting fat. Though as belly dancers, it is visually pleasing to have a bit of fats around the belly area, that’s where you get all the shimmy action.

The average recommended calories per day for <strong>men is 2500kCal</strong> and for <strong>women is 2000kCal</strong>. But this number fluctuates when you factor in your lifestyle. An endurance athlete may consume up to 8000kCal per day.

While most of the dancers that I know of don’t train at the level of elite athletes, we tend to burn off more energy than the average office workers. I want to assure you that calorie is not evil. Fundamentally, calorie means a unit of energy. All human needs calories, i,e. energy. We need it to move, and to fuel our movements. If you are practicing for an average of 2 hours a day, you will need to consume more food to fuel your physical activities. The idea is to experiment with your calories intake and form a loving relationship with food.

Having said that, not all calories are created equal, read on to find out how you should make your calories count.
<h2>2. Stay away from empty calories</h2>
You can eat all you want, but you have to be wise in your food selection. Make your food counts. There are certain kinds of calories that are known as empty calories. Empty calories are calories that are just calories, they have very little or even none of the vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and dietary fiber. I like to call them cheap fuel. All they do is make you feel full without doing anything much to improve your health and performance.

Zero calories are found in <strong>anything with lots of sugar and sweetener</strong>, your soda, cakes, cookies, cereals and etc. While consuming empty calories might not be scary to you, the fact that sugar accelerates skin aging should sound an alarm.

Another group of food with zero calories are <strong>food with lots of fats, especially the saturated and trans fat</strong>. They are common in fast food, where almost everything is deep fried. Potato chips and crackers, packaged frozen snacks all contain a high amount of fats and empty calories.

I don’t want to deprive you of your gastronomical pleasure, I myself enjoy a cup of sweetened coffee every now and then. The key is to limit intakes. If you are confused with all these “empty” talks, just follow my rule of thumb: <strong>avoid processed food as much as possible</strong>. It is always the best to eat food that is produced straight from Mother Nature. However, if that is not possible, choose the items with the least amount of ingredients in the list. I like to err on the side of caution. If I spot something that sound like it comes from a lab, like propylene glycol alginate (E405) or sodium benzoate, I’m staying away.
<h2>3. Get the iron</h2>
People involved in regular intensive physical tend to deplete their iron stores. <strong>When our iron level is low, we might feel lethargic, have a poor appetite, slow down and increase our risk of injury.</strong> All these will lead to poor training, which will ultimately results in poor performance.

<strong>Foods high in iron are soybeans, blackstrap molasses, lentils, spinach, beans and broccoli.</strong> To improve your iron intake, consume iron rich food with vitamin C. Fortunately, vegetables high in iron, like broccoli and bok choy, are also rich in vitamin C, so it definitely saves us a lot of hassle. Avoid consuming tannin (coffee and tea) with iron because they reduce absorption of iron.

Next week we will go through another 4 tips on diet to help you improve your diet. <strong>If you want us to send you a reminder when the post is up, subscribe</strong> through the subscription box on our side or at the bottom of our website :D

Last week, we explore the <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/7-simple-eating-habits-to-make-you-a-better-dancer-part-1/">3 eating habits to boost your dance performance</a>. Let’s do a quick recap:
<h3><strong>#1: Don’t be afraid of high calories intake</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>#2: Stay away from empty calories</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>#3: Get the iron</strong></h3>
This week, we will continue to explore 4 other eating habits for you to perform better as a dancer.
<h2>4. Stock up on antioxidants</h2>
I’m sure you are familiar with the term antioxidants. The fruit juice cartons love to have it on their labels and you constantly hear about antioxidants as an anti-ageing agent. You hear that you have to have them in your diet, supplements market themselves on it but do you know what they really do?

Now, let’s get into the fun and geeky part.

Our body produced something called free radicals. Exercising also creates free radicals. White blood cells produce free radicals to kill bacteria and viruses. In general, free radicals are necessary in our bodily functions. <strong>However, these free radicals also cause ageing, damage other important components of cells, e.g. DNA and weaken our immune system.</strong> It’s like any countries with radical citizens. Keep them in control and they work well for you. When their number gets out of hand, then it’s time to prepare for chaos.

So that’s where antioxidants come in. Antioxidants will interact with your radicals and neutralize them. Examples of antioxidants are vitamin C, E, carotenoid and lutein. Vegetables and fruits are color coded with the antioxidants in them. For example in blue, it is anthocyanin and in red, it is carotenoid. Even if it is white, it contains flavonoids.

<strong>So in a nut shell, eat a whole plate of food with natural occurring colors to stock up on those antioxidants.</strong> The key word here is naturally occurring: vegetables and fruits should contribute to those colors, froot loops do not qualify.
<h2>5. Eat your carbohydrates</h2>
As with calories, carbohydrates have earned itself a bad name, mainly in making people fat and sick. However, carbohydrates are very important to athletes and performance artist.

The carbohydrates that we consume get transformed into glucose and stores into our muscles as glycogen.<strong> When we are involved in physical activities, our body will use this glycogen as our main source of energy.</strong> In a study of a group of Kenya runners, (Kenyans dominate the running competitions) about 76.5% of their diets are carbohydrates.

Whole grains like whole wheat pasta and whole wheat bread, spelt, quinoa, brown rice, sweet potatoes and whole oats are good sources of carbohydrates to fuel your dance activity.
<h2>6. Hydrate yourself</h2>
Dehydration will cause fatigue and decreased performance. Always remember to hydrate yourself. Water helps to transport the nutrients and maintain your body temperature, so as to prevent overheating. Don’t wait until you are thirsty before drinking water. If you are feeling thirsty, you are already dehydrated. So bring a reusable water bottle with you everywhere and sip often.
<h2>7. Post dance practice recovery</h2>
You see people with protein shakes after their gym workouts. You see runners with their Gatorades after their training. I don't know about you but I have never heard of people talking about post dance practice recovery. It is as if our practice is not strenuous and will not cause soreness in our body. Go on ahead to disregard this point if you have never feel worn out from your practice. But if you do, read on.

<strong>Protein will help to enhance muscle recovery and carbohydrates will aid in creating insulin that is essential in transporting the nutrient into the cell.</strong>

Consuming carbohydrates after your dance practice will help to refuel the glycogen in your muscles. It is important that we get our proteins and carbohydrates within 15-45 minutes for proper recovery, however, exercise usually suppress our diets. In such cases, you could prepare your own post recovery smoothie by blending fruits, soymilk, dates and coconut water together. To find out more about post dance recovery nutrition, you can also look into this blog post, <a href="http://www.nomeatathlete.com/post-workout-recovery/" target="_blank">The 7 Secrets of Post-Workout Recovery</a>.

As you can see, proper nutrition and eating habits are very important to a dancer, especially if he/she wants career longevity and better performance. So now, eat well and share this article with your dancer friends. :D

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1. Becoming vegan is the most important and direct change we can immediately make to save the planet and its species. <em>– Chris Hedges</em>

2. Cruelty to animals is an enormous injustice; so is expecting those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder to do the dangerous, soul-numbing work of slaughtering sentient beings on our behalf. <em>– Victoria Moran</em>

3. Don't wait for a better world. Start now to create a world of harmony and peace. It is up to you, and it always has been. You may even find the solution at the end of your fork. <em>– Sharon Gannon</em>

4. Violence begins with the fork.<em> – Mahatma Gandhi</em>

5. Veganism is not about giving anything up or losing anything; it is about gaining the peace within yourself that comes from embracing nonviolence and refusing to participate in the exploitation of the vulnerable. <em>– Gary L. Francione</em>

6. People often say that humans have always eaten animals, as if this is a justification for continuing to the practice. According to this logic, we should not try to prevent people from murdering other people, since this has also been done since the earliest of times. <em>– Isaac Bashevis Singer</em>

7. A man is ethical only when life, as such, is sacred to him, that of plants and animals as that of his fellow men, and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in need of help. <em>– Albert Schweitzer</em>

8. Could you look an animal in the eyes and say to it, 'My appetite is more important than your suffering? <em>– Moby</em>

9. Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened. <em>– Anatole France</em>

10. There is no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery. <em>– Charles Darwin</em>

11. The question is not, 'Can they reason?' nor, 'Can they talk?' but rather, 'Can they suffer?’ <em>– Jeremy Bentham</em>

12. Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet. <em>– Albert Einstein</em>

13. Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else? If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious threat facing the planet (global warming) isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when? – <em>Jonathan Safran Foer</em>

14. If slaughterhouses had glass walls, we would all be vegetarian. <em>– Paul McCartney</em>

15. It's a pretty amazing to wake up every morning, knowing that every decision I make is to cause as little harm as possible. It's a pretty fantastic way to live. – <em>Colleen Patrick-Goudreau</em>

16. Make ethical choices in what we buy, do, and watch. In a consumer-driven society our individual choices, used collectively for the good of animals and nature, can change the world faster than laws. – <em>Marc Bekoff</em>

17. You either approve of violence or you don't, and nothing on earth is more violent or extreme than the meat industry. – <em>Morrissey</em>

18. The human body has no more need for cows' milk than it does for dogs' milk, horses' milk, or giraffes' milk. – <em>Michael Klaper</em>

19. Recognize meat for what it really is: the antibiotic- and pesticide-laden corpse of a tortured animal. – <em>Ingrid Newkirk</em>

20. We all love animals. Why do we call some "pets" and others "dinner?" – <em>k.d. lang</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you have endless deadlines to meet? Are you in debt? Do you feel overwhelmed with work and family commitments?
<h2><strong>As breathing and living beings, it is normal to feel stress.</strong></h2>
Animals in the wild feel it and animals in captivity feel it. Our ancestors, the early human also feel it.

Before we get to learn to manage stress, we have to understand what is stress.
<h3><strong>Stress is an evolution mechanism to ensure survival in the wild. </strong></h3>
Our ancestors have to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_evolution/2012/10/evolution_of_anxiety_humans_were_prey_for_predators_such_as_hyenas_snakes.html" target="_blank">run away from monstrous animals like saber-tooth cats, snakes and killer kangaroos</a>. As so, their bodies have evolved to release adrenaline that speed up the heart, increase blood flow to muscles and decreased functioning of immune system.

<strong>Basically, the body is now focusing on preparation of getting out of danger through a fight or flight response.</strong>

In those days, it works well.

There is a known short-term stress inducer and the symptoms will wear off when the threat is avoided or removed.

However, in our modern world, our threats are always there: the next meeting, taxes, anniversary, being late and so on. Although the stress trigger point of modern day living is very different, our response to stress physiologically remains.
<h2><strong>Nowadays, our body is constantly in a fight or flight response mode.</strong></h2>
This has a negative effect on the body, because its focus is shifted away from our immune and digestive systems, producing a weakened immune system and digestive problems, and overworking the heart.

Some of the symptoms of stress have became so serious that some of us have to pop pills to control it. However, we can avoid stress-induced diseases if we look into our lifestyle. Yoga as a holistic practice have many techniques to help us to manage stress. Today, we are going to discuss on the 5 techniques that will make you feel better in 5 minutes.
<h2>1. Lift your chest and feel the expansion in your body</h2>
Our physical health is closely linked to our mental health. Stress do ultimately manifest on our body as disease. Luckily, it is a two ways street: whatever happens to the mind will affect the body, and whatever happens to the body will affect the mind. A fake smile can boost your mood.¹ Take some time to observe your body postures when you are feeling happy and upset. When you are happy, you will feel relaxed and lifted. When you are upset, you will feel like closing in dropping your head. Change your mood by adapting a “happy” posture.

<strong>Stand in mountain pose, feet hips width apart, shoulders by the side of your body.</strong> Take a moment to ground through your feet. Lift your spine. Check that your neck is in neutral position and your chin is not jutted out or tucked in.

<strong>Inhale, lift your hands either by the side or by the front of your body, to reach above your head.</strong> Make sure you are not shrugging your shoulder. We are aiming for a feeling of openness in the body. Rotate your elbow outwards without compressing the shoulder blades at the back. I call this a ballerina posture because it gives you a feeling of lightness and openness.

<strong>Exhale. On the next inhale, move into a slight backbend by lengthening your lower back and lifting your chest while maintaining the alignment of the neck with the spine.</strong> We are not crunching our lower back. Rather, we are engaging our core muscles and expanding our frontal part of our body. Throughout this movement, you should feel lifted and supported.

<strong>Exhale, move back to mountain position and drop your hands the side of the body.</strong>

It doesn’t have to be a very deep backbend. This is especially so if you are doing this after you are working on your desk for hours. You want to be gentle here and focus more on stimulating the positivity in your body.
<h2>2. Downward facing dog or any forward bend</h2>
Inhalation and exhalation induces a different response in our body. Think about your breathing when you are shock and when you are relieved. When you are shock, your first reaction, is to inhale deeply and sharply, and often, you will have a tendency to hold your breath. When you are relieved, you tend to exhale and hence the term, “heave a sigh of relief”. As such, relaxation is promoted when we move into asanas that are exhale based: the forward bends and twist. For our purpose of stress relieving, I find forward bend better. You can do any gentle forward bend, but for the point of illustration, I will use downward facing dog.<strong>
Position yourself in a cat position.</strong> You are on all fours, knees are hips width apart, aligned below your hips. Your wrists are shoulders width apart, aligned below your shoulders. Neck is in a neutral position, aligned with your spine. Your spine is in a neutral position, there is no arching or rounding of the back.

<strong>Exhale, move to downward facing dog.</strong> Create space around your neck and shoulder region. You can either maintain a neutral position in the neck or you can slightly tuck your neck. Feel your spine and hamstring lengthening towards the sky.

Bend your knees and lift your ankles if you need to. Over here, we are focusing on cultivating the sense of peace and stillness, which will not work if you are constantly commanding your body to stretch pass its limit.

Next week we will go through <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/5-yoga-techniques-to-manage-your-stress-in-5-minutes-part-2/">another 3 methods to manage stress</a> in our modern daily life. <strong>If you want us to send you a reminder when the post is up, subscribe</strong> through the subscription box on our side or at the bottom of our website <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://www.mysantosh.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nine in the night,
people on the streets,
hands in hands, arms linking
on a Friday night.

Cocktails in hand, beer in tower,
both locals and foreigners alike frequent the river.
Murky water, alcoholic vapours,
the Turkish ice cream man continues tricking his patrons.

Music blaring, the top hits, DJ playing, sometimes in a trance.
Skimpy skirt, heels, and low cut dresses,
cigarette in hand, put it to their velvet lips,
pucker it.

Off the streets, boy on his own. At the bus stop, waiting for his next ride.
Can’t keep up with the news on the net,
seizing every moment of it, scrolling through the web.
Not noticing the people who pass by, or maybe just looking up enough,
to spot a hot lady passing by.

Girl, alone. T-shirt, sport pants and canvas shoe.
A blade of grass among the flowers.
This modern society, she wonders.
Dubious men and vendors.
All not heading home to sleep,
to accompany the family they keep.

Girl. Heading home. Busses whir past,
the traffic never stops
throughout all these affairs.
Nine in the night, she watches still
she will never really be at home.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the outback, there is this girl,
who wears shirt and yoga pants, and sometimes her jogging shorts.
Sports bra beneath, nothing fancy with those pinkish, lacey,
stringy and tiny intimate.

She is a person who understands marketing
as a verb to go to the market for groceries.
In her, failing in every business sense of way.
A tote bag in hand,
it says, “refuse plastic, save our earth.”
with a green sea turtle on it.

By any chance, by a huge leap of faith,
an unwavering faith, you dare to wager,
you reckon this girl to be a vegetarian or a tree hugger.
An independent soul nevertheless, how much misfit she is
in this society of economic progress.

Progress, to her, mind you, she is just a girl,
is about love, about bringing love to everyone around.
Bounding in earth, naked feet and flower wreath.
Daffodils, tulips and primroses.
She prances in those tall grasses,
in cream white dress, which she wears
every once in a while, in the good days she feels
like dolling up.

She smiles, the sun shines through the leaves,
new shoots of leaves.
Tender, like her fingers,
with nails trim short, au naturel.

She skips her appointment in the city,
just so she could spend more time in nature.
Her backyard is her world: squirrels, goose,
duck, herons, kingfisher, salmon, sturgeon.
Her list of sightings continue on.
Spring, summer, autumn winter.
Regardless, she’ll be out. Those good days,
in her cream white dress and other sundresses.

More often though, you'll see her in overalls and boots,
or shirt and sport pants. This is the way she is.
This girl, nibbling a cookie straight from the oven,
even with her dirt-covered hand.
There's nothing to do about her, she is just a girl.

You know what I'm saying when you meet her.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Day three of feeling, with a lack of better word,
like shit.
Every facial orifices going to explode.
Nose, threatening to burst off,
eyes, blood shot,
and the pressure in the ears that alternate between pressing in and popping out.

The throbs of the head. Heavy rain.
The first that I feel the distinction of my eyebrow, the arch and the brow bone.
I couldn’t turn my head so much without feeling my brain might just not turn in time.
If there wasn’t a skull, it might just splatter like tofu.

Cups of cinnamon-pepper tea, mint-pepper tea,
honey lemon tea, chinese herbal flu tea and salt gurgle.
Looking up, it feels like somebody just land a punch on my eye.

The night before, restful night perhaps,
if you discount the interim of waking up.
As if I was rested enough, but still without the strength
to stay fully awake.

Eleven, it is still raining outside.
My body mimicking the weather.
Yearning to step afoot, into the rain, spiraling and sing.
Yet I couldn’t even dance, haven’t been for two days,
due to the soreness around the sacral and thoracic.

And to think, I’m a certified yoga teacher, bogged with all these.
But yoga, doesn’t make one omnipotent, despite mass marketing.
And to reemphasize, yoga is more than the physical.

Because I’m practice yoga, I know to take my rest,
to listen to my body. And not to slog off, whirring in the insanity
of the gold rush.

I’m still human, going through bouts of immunity exercises,
or so I hope. The muscles that don’t work atrophy, and
so must be the case for our immunity.

A day off, a book in hand. Just lazing around, no work.
The body becomes stronger when it is given a day of rest,
Our body is adaptable, and we need no science to prove it.
Feel it, alive and healthy, mostly.

But for today, I’m resting. Relaxing, without the buzz in my head
and the rush to achieve.
Because my body tells me to.
And it feels so good too.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, we talk about <a title="5 yoga techniques to manage your stress in 5 minutes: Part 1" href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/5-yoga-techniques-to-manage-stress-part-1/" target="_blank">2 techniques to relieve stress using physical movements</a>. We understand that you probably can’t apply those when you are working without getting unnecessary attention. Today, we are going to finish this 2 part series so with tools that you can cope with your stress anywhere anytime. You can apply these techniques in a public transport, workplace, restroom and restaurant without anybody knowing it.
<h2>3. Breathe deeply</h2>
As we mention last week, our breath and emotion are intricately connection. To do a quick recap, fast and short breathing are associated with restlessness and strong emotions like shock and anger. On the other hand, deep and slow breathing are associated with relaxation. Here are 2 ways to make breathing into a stress relieving activity in 5 minutes.
<h3><strong>Method 1</strong></h3>
Focus on your breath, make it deep, gentle and smooth. When you feel that your mind is wandering away from the breath, gently bring it back.
<h3><strong>Method 2</strong></h3>
Inhale, count your inhalation. Exhale, count your exhalation. Inhale, count your inhalation. Exhale, this time round make the count of your exhalation double the count of inhalation. Repeat.
<h2>4. Engage in light mindfulness activity</h2>
You don’t have to meditate to be practicing mindfulness. In fact, mindfulness should be a practice that you can engage in anytime. Preferably, you should be applying mindfulness to your every waking moment. Practicing is as simple as being aware of what you is around you right at this moment. Every minute is an opportunity for you to practice awareness. Here is one example each for practicing mindfulness at home and at work.
<h3><strong>Home</strong></h3>
When doing mundane house chore, it is easy for your mind to be filled with thoughts. Instead of rushing to finish the chore, take 5 minutes to tap into your inner well of awareness by becoming present in whatever you are holding on or doing. Say you are washing dishes, become aware of the weight, color and size of the dishes. Next, turn your awareness to the lather that is produced by the detergent. Notice the color, the volume and the feeling of the foam. Turn your awareness into the water that rinse the dishes clean. Notice the temperature and how it runs down the dishes. By doing this, you will be gradually building up your mindfulness “muscles”, and it will be applied more smoothly into your life when a difficult moment arises.
<h3><strong>Work</strong></h3>
Say you have met with a difficult problem in your project. Our tendency is to work even harder at the problem and squeeze our brain dry. While this might work for some situations, we might get a better result if we have the courage to momentarily let go of the problem in our mind and return to it with a fresh mind.

The Pareto’s Principle states that 80% of our results are derived by 20% of our efforts. So take the courage to let go of the notion that being busy is being productive. Sometimes, it is more practical, productive and better for your well-being to take 5 minutes off your work to apply the mindfulness practice described above (at home) to any of your surrounding at work.
<h2>5. Tune in to your current state and release tension</h2>
Researchers in Finland map bodily sensations associated with different emotions¹. Last week, we talk about how stress triggers a chain of “fight-or-flight” reactions in our body. This week, we will add muscle tensions to the reactions. With this understanding, we will be engaging our physical body as a tool to access our mind.

First, scan your body for muscle tensions. Due to our sedentary lifestyle, this will usually be, but not limited to, shoulders, neck and lower back.

Next, introduce some movements, rotation, extension or flexion to the tense region.

Focus on progressively releasing the tension on the muscles. Alternatively, you can deliberately tense up your muscles and releases them. Focus on the relaxation sensation and breathe deeply to further release your muscle tension.

Here are my 5 techniques to manage your stress in 5 minutes. <strong>Do you have any other techniques that you use to release your stress in 5 minutes?</strong> Let us know in the comment section below.

		<title>5 yoga asanas to improve your belly dance techniques - Part 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Do you want to execute cleaner and sharper belly dance techniques?</h2>
Have you been practicing for an hour a day everyday but still find your techniques lacking the clean and sharp execution? Maybe you have to look beyond drilling to improve your belly dance techniques. Professional athletes do strength training and endurance training.
<h3>Basically, they cross train to improve their performance.</h3>
I’m a fan of adopting athlete style training into my belly dance training and I a firm believer of cross-training to improve your belly dance performance. Cross-training means training in other sports other than your main sports. So for dancers, it goes to mean practicing other form of exercises other than dance to train your muscles group to improve your overall dance performance.

I'm simplifying things here, but here is a list of a few muscles group with the belly dance techniques. We need both strength and flexibility in this muscles group to execute the techniques well.

<strong>Shimmy: Thighs, glutes</strong>

<strong>Maya: Obliques</strong>

<strong>Hip drop/raise: Glutes, obliques, knees</strong>

<strong>Undulation: Core and back</strong>

So in order to improve your belly dance techniques, you need to improve your strenth and flexibility in the muscles group. And to achieve that, yoga is a suitable platform. We will be exploring 5 yoga postures (asanas) that will help us to build strength and flexibility in the muscles group.

This description are just guidelines and are not meant to replace the professional supervision and guidance of a certified yoga teacher.
<h2>1. Bridge pose. Dwipadapitham</h2>
<strong> Target area: Glutes, back, quadriceps, knees</strong>
Lie semi-supine on the floor with your finger tips pointing towards the feet.
Ensure your neck is in a neutral position.
Engage your quadriceps so that the knee does not turn out.
Inhale, lift your self into bridge pose by leading with the chest, lifting your quadriceps and engaging your glutes. Make sure your knees are not rolling outwards and you are not crunching your lower back. Maintain an extended lower back. The opening should come mostly from the upper back.
Exhale, slowly lower yourself to semi-supine position.
<h2>2. Warrior 1. Virabhadrasana 1</h2>
<strong>Target area: Quadriceps, knee, arms, back, hips, shoulders</strong>
Take one large step back with your right feet. You should be able to comfortably return to normal standing position with one step.
Turn your right feet 45 to 60 degrees to the right. Traditionally, the left heel is keep in line with the right heel. However, for better balance, you can widen the distance between the left heel and the right heel. A wider base will give you more stability. Ground yourself through both heels, making sure that you are not just supporting yourself on the inner side of the foot.
Inhale, lift your arms above your head.
Exhale, bend forward.
Inhale, extend your body and arms and move into warrior 1. Bend your left knee to a comfortable angle, making sure that your left knee does not go over your left ankle. Keep your neck in neutral position or even tuck it in. You want to avoid hyperextension of the neck.
Rather than sinking into the posture to form a deep arch that does little except to look fanciful, you want to be lifting yourself upwards (engage the whole of your thigh and lower back to do this). Extend your lower back and focus on the backbend on the upper back. Again, you want to avoid crunching your lower back.

&nbsp;

For our <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/yoga-improve-belly-dance-part-2/">next post</a>, we will have 3 more postures that will work even deeper and harder at the targeted area. Subscribe to our blog if you do not want to miss the update.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, we talk about the first <a title="5 yoga asanas to improve your belly dance techniques – Part 1" href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-yoga-asanas-for-belly-dance-techniques-part-1/">2 asanas that will help you to improve your dance techniques</a>. Today, we are going to jump right in to share 3 more asanas that you can add to your practice.
<h2>3. Standing half forward bend. Ardha uttanasana.</h2>
<strong>Target area:</strong> <strong>Hamstring, back, arm</strong>
Your starting position will be a full forward bend.
Ground through your feet. Inhale, lengthen your spine.
Exhale, move slightly deeper into your forward bend.
Inhale, raise your arms and back into ardha uttanasa, while maintaining the stretch in your spine.
Your back will slightly resemble a back bend but there should not be an exaggerated arch in the lower back. If there is an exaggerate arch, adjust yourself by bending you knees or extending out further.
Inhale, come into a standing position while maintaining the stretch of the spine and arms.
Exhale, lower your arms to the side.
<h2>4. Side plank. V<span class="st">asisthasana </span></h2>
<strong>Target area: Core, obliques, arm. </strong>

Your starting position will be a downward facing dog.
Exhale, feel yourself grounding through your hands and feet.
Inhale.
Exhale, feel yourself shifting the weight to your left, while remaining in downward facing dog.
Inhale, lift off to a side plank. Feel the openness in the chest region while grounding yourself on your left hand and feet.
Exhale, move back into a downward facing dog or a child pose.
<h2>5. Chair pose. Utkatasana.</h2>
<strong>Target area: The whole body</strong>

All yoga postures require the coordination of the whole body, but in the chair pose, you will feel your muscles working very strongly. Since this posture puts a lot of pressure on the knee and requires a lot of back strength, it is not advisable to try this if you have weak knee and back.
Your starting position will be standing position.
Inhale, raise your arms above your head.
Exhale, lower yourself to chair pose pose. Lift your tummy and chest away from your thighs, while again, making sure that your lower back is not arch in an exaggerated way.
Inhale, rotate your elbows outward to open up your upper back.
Exhale, if you like to you can go into a deeper squat. But make sure that the back is still held upright without any exaggerated arches.
Inhale, come back up to the standing position.

&nbsp;

In yoga asana practices, there are actually many different ways to move in and out of the asanas. Over here, I have given you the easiest and safest way to perform the asanas described in this series for belly dancers. If you wish to learn to go deeper into your practice, it is advisable to consult a qualified teacher for guidance and correction.

Other than that, practice, cross train, persevere and see how your performance improve at a quicker rate.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I just lost a friend.</h2>
He was a good man, doing charity work, spearheading numerous activities and being involved in many community works. He lived in the spirit of service, despite his health condition, which had afflicted him since birth. No one could recgonise the battle he had to face each day because he was always smiling and exuding positivity. He was a good friend and a good man.

Although we hadn't have too much opportunity to meet up ever since graduation, his death still impacted me a lot. Sometimes, we realised what we have missed only when we have lost them forever. Forever, a word, that seems foul except when it is used in fairytale endings, but forever is non-discriminatory.
<h3>I guess if I have a faith system, his death will have been much easier to handle.</h3>
It will be much easier to believe in an afterlife or heaven or rebirth. It will be most comforting to be able to know with full conviction that somehow, when everybody dies, we will all meet again in one place.

But I guess, this is when it comes to test the faith of being an atheist. I couldn’t believe in heaven, because it must have been overpopulated by now. Rebirth might be more convincing, but even if it is real, it is a distant truth. For me, I could only focus on this life, the time that I have and the plane that I am in now.
<h2>I have strong faith.</h2>
I believe that we are all forms of energy. We are made of genomes, muscles, fats, cells, electrical impulses, chemical reactions, hormones, bones and so on. Our whole body is teeming with energy and vibrations of atoms, even when our hearts stop beating. Our spirit leave our body and there could be seemingly no sign of life. But memories, dreams and experiences are stored onto the different locations of our bodies. We might have not been alive anymore, but our bodies remember our friends, conflicts, tears, joys, triumphs and our adventures.

As a gardener, I learn that there is no real distinction between life and death, it is actually a cycle, a smooth gradient from one to each, whereby the transition is never clearly demarcated.
<h3>Only through the existence of death could the celebration of life be made possible.</h3>
If you ask me, the one definite purpose in life for everyone, is really, to die. In our life, we could try hard to define our life purpose, but all could only have been our perception of reality. To die is our reality. Each and every day, every morning, we live a little more, and yet we also die a little bit more.

But then again, when we die, we never exactly die, as in completely cease to exist. We go back to the earth, we break down, and become part of the earth, part of the river and part of the atmosphere.
<h2>Once again, we become the source of life.</h2>
We return to where we are from, in new energy forms. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. So we are, as human beings, as a vessel of varying energies, are never truly created or destroyed. We are all in a process of conversion of energy.

So, it is the beauty of such natural law, that we could come to celebrate death. It is precisely in death, the morphing of our memories, dreams and experiences into different material forms, that we come to surround ourselves with the spirit of life.
<h3>My faith stands, that upon death, we become the world and it is in so, that we will never die.</h3>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>3 mistakes in yoga asanas that are destroying your knees</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Yoga and the knees</h2>
When it comes to yoga asanas, we have a few postures that demand a lot from the knees. Practice correctly, these postures will strengthen our knees and correct any misalignment due to muscular weakness and stiffness. However, if we don’t practice with mindfulness, we will hurt ourselves in the process. This is why yoga practice places emphasis on personal alignment, breathing and awareness.

For me, the first time that I practice Virasana, hero pose, I feel the whole of my quadriceps pulling strongly and I have to prop blankets to support myself, all the while, wondering how could anybody actually go into a full reclined in this posture. Structurally, I’m born with a little bit of duck feet (i.e. when my knees point forward, my feet will spread out about 10° to the side, just like the feet of a duck.) Until today, my hips can’t touch the floor in Virasana if I follow the alignment described in the pose.

But that’s fine, yoga is not about performing a form, it’s about getting the maximal function out of the postures. Some people have skeletal and muscular structure that allows them to be more flexible than the others. Some have body type that can gain strength more easily than others. We need to learn to accept and honour the structural differences (or limitations at that point of time), rather than taking yoga practices as a competition with a make it or break it mentality.

Here are 3 mistakes that people make in their yoga practices that are doing more harm than good to the knees.
<h2>1. Locking out your knee</h2>
Locking out your joints means that you fully extend the joint till you couldn’t straighten it anymore. <strong>Locking of the joints transfers the weight-bearing activity from the muscles to the joints.</strong> Our joints are connected with ligaments. When we practice yoga by locking our joints, we are placing a lot of stress on these ligaments, causing them to wear out faster. At the same time, you are not strengthening your muscles. And locking out causes instability in your poses, making you more susceptible to losing your balance.

Besides the knee, locking of the joint will also occur in the elbows. Standing poses like tree pose and triangle pose might cause you to lock your knees. Poses that requires arm support like side plank and downward facing dog might cause you to lock your elbows. To prevent this locking of your joints, you want to engage your muscles in the asanas. This will mean lifting your arches and kneecap in standing position. For the elbows, it will mean introducing a micro bend into the elbow while keeping them straight.
<h2>2. Twisting the knee</h2>
<strong> Our knee is a hinge joint, similar to the hinge of a door.</strong> This means it is supposed to be only bending and straightening your legs. Your knee can allows a small degree of twist due to its structure, but this is not what it is supposed to do. Poses like padmasana and virasana puts your knee at strain, especially if they are done by twisting the kneecap.

To go into a proper padmasana, the rotation should be initiated in your hips and thighs, rather than your knees. If you feel pinching sensations in your knees, then it is a signal for you to back off from the postures. For virasana, prop up, place blankets or blocks under your hips. Place your feet is in line with your shin. The rule of the thumb is always, "no pain, no pain." Never should any of your asanas practice be painful.
<h2>3.Attempting strong poses when your body is not ready</h2>
In my teacher training, we are taught to personalized yoga practices for individuals according to their strength and flexibility. A physical yoga practice should not be merely about contorting yourself or going into impressive looking postures. <strong>A yoga practice should be about supporting the natural function of the body, building strength and increasing flexibility that is functional.</strong>

If you have tight muscles, and you push yourself to stretch further than your muscles allow you to, you are most probably stretching your ligaments. Ligaments are flexible but they do not stretch a lot. If they are pulled too hard, they will tear. Once that happens, it can take a very long time for ligaments to heal due to the limited blood and nerve supply they receive.

In the case of the knees, your quadriceps might not be strong enough to hold the knee in proper alignment in a warrior or full squat pose. Or your hamstring might be too tight, thus forcing your quadriceps to work harder. This in turn creates strain in the knee. Go gentle on your body, begin with the easy poses, and slowly build your strength and flexibility. Remember Rome is not build in one day, so don't expect your body to do what you see in Instagram accounts without working intelligently towards it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shimmy is a belly dance move that is executed through moving our limbs at a fast speed to create movements or vibrations at a particular region of the body. In belly dance, we have hips shimmy, shoulders shimmy, walking shimmy and many other variations. It can be a lot of challenge to get it going initially but once you are able to accomplish it, you can wow yourself and your friends with this fascinating belly dance moves.
<h2>Benefits of belly dancing</h2>
Of course, shimmy is just one small part of belly dance. Belly dance comprises of many different techniques. Today we are going to look at <strong>5 benefits that you can derived from belly dancing.</strong>
<h2>5. Improve posture</h2>
Regardless of the forms of dance, basic dance posture is the first thing to be taught. We stand tall and upright as this improves the quality of the dance, both visually and energetically. By carrying this posture in dance, it will help us to build awareness of our body such that we can improve our postures in our day to day living. Since belly dance is considered a low impact dance, it could be learned by people from age 5 to 65, or even beyond that age, depending on the health conditions of the individual.
<h2>4. Improve core stability</h2>
Belly dance is a dance form that focuses a lot on isolation of the body parts. One example will be using our hips to draw a figure of eight. Doing this action requires strength and flexibility from our back and oblique muscles. In essence, we are twisting our body in a controlled manner. Any form of controlled movements requires muscular strength. Since the movements of belly dance is concentrated greatly in the torso region, practicing the dance techniques will help us to improve our core stability.
<h2>3. Boost immunity</h2>
Exercise can boost our immune system. Dancing can help us to build resistance to the common cold and other infections. As a bonus, dancing has an additional tool when it comes to boosting our immune system: music. Scientists have found that just by listening to 50 minutes of uplifting music, the levels of antibodies increased. At the same time, the stress hormones level, which can weaken the immune system, decreases. ¹
<h2>2. Improve self-esteem and confidence</h2>
Science has more things to say about belly dance. Belly dancers have a positive body image.² Belly dance is a very accepting dance form. Men and women of different sizes, shapes and age could join. By taking up belly dance, we learn to accept ourselves as who we are and invite ourselves to be amazed by the possibilities of our body.
<h2>1. Rediscover and reconnect with the body</h2>
Nowadays, a lot of us work in office, sitting long hours at our desk. This causes muscles strain and muscles loss. The one group of muscles that is affected greatly will be the gluteal muscles, the muscles at our hips. The atrophy of this muscle causes sagging buttocks. Since our gluteal muscles cannot function optimally, our lumbar spine will be taking up part of the stress, which might lead to lower back pain overtime. However, through belly dance, we can start to awake this muscles. We do a lot of hip movements, which as you can guess, requires the gluteal muscles to execute. Belly dance offers a wide range of movements for you to utilize different muscles group in your body, and hence providing you a chance to rediscover and reconnect with your body.

Belly dancers, what other benefits do you feel when you are dancing? <strong>Let us know in the comment section below.</strong>

		<title>3 exercise science that all yoga practitioners should know</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yoga can be spiritual, physical and/or mental exercise for the practitioners. Some practitioners do mostly pranayama. Some like hand balances and strong posture. Some do raja yoga, the yoga of meditation. The beauty of yoga is that there is a variety of practices that appeals to people of different personalities and needs.

But generally, most people know yoga as a physical practice. The practice of <em>asanas</em>, the physical postures, is a form of physical exercise. Even though yoga is considered to be of low impact, you still can get hurt (read<strong>: sports injuries</strong>) if you don’t practice it with the right knowledge and mindfulness.
<h2>Enter exercise science</h2>
Having said that, yoga is a great movement-based activity to engage it. It helps one to focus, reduce stress, build strength and many more. We could gain more benefits from yoga if we <strong>educate ourselves on these 3 exercise science.  </strong>

Prevent injuries and optimize the practice.
<h2>3. Stretching is not a warm up</h2>
In my younger days, warming up means static stretching, the kind that you hold the stretch for seconds. But science has proven that <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/777155" target="_blank">static stretching as a warm up decreases muscular strength and power</a>. A warm up should preferably be a dynamic activity that gradually increases the body internal temperature and prepares the body for more rigorous demands of the session. It should be a combination of light aerobic exercises and active stretches.

Don’t stretch a cold muscle. Yoga classes should never start with static stretches. When you do static stretches before exercising, your body may think it's at risk of being overstretched. It compensates by contracting and becoming more tense. That means you aren't able to move as fast or as freely, making you more likely to get hurt.
<h2>2. Stretch properly</h2>
Yoga is not only about stretching, but since it is what comes into people mind when they first think about stretching, we will continue to talk a little more about the science of stretching. Never do a ballistic stretch, that is bouncing while you stretch. By attempting to use the momentum to stretch further, you are not allowing your muscles to adjust to the stretch and can cause injuries. Also, ballistic stretching activates the <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/masrjb/Stretch/stretching_2.html#SEC15" target="_blank">stretch reflex</a>, causing the muscles to contract, thus defeating the purpose of stretching.

To stretch correctly, move to a point where you feel tension in your muscles without discomfort, avoid pain and hold the stretch for 15 to 60 seconds with two to four repetitions.
<h2>3. Some postures can be a little too extreme to your hips</h2>
Don’t we just adore the picture of yogis in the extreme backbends and extreme forward bends? Don’t we just wish that we are as bendy as them? It seems to me that images that inspired people to practice yoga are people with flexibilities that can qualify them into cirque du soleil. But unless we are really part of the entertainment company, there is no valid reason for most of us to work towards some extreme postures.

Working in such extreme postures could cause damage to our hips joints. Our hips are ball and socket joint and this kind of joint allows a large range of motion. When we move jam our thigh bone into our hips: forward bending, splits, putting our legs behind our head, it will create friction in the hips joint. If we happen to have <a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00571" target="_blank">femoroacetabular impingement </a><a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00571" target="_blank">(FAI) </a><a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00571" target="_blank">forms</a>, the femoral head will rub abnormally against the acetabulum, creating addition friction, which will potentially create damage to the hip joint. FAI can cause pain in the hips area and it is also associated with cartilage damage, labral tears, early hip arthritis, sports hernias, and low back pain.

Respect the limits of your body, stay away from pain and drop your ego and competitiveness in a yoga practice.

What are some of the exercise science that you think yogis should equip themselves with? Share with us in the comment section below.

		<title>5 facts about our spine that yoga teachers should know to prevent injuries - Part 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In yoga, there is a saying, “You are Only as Young as your Spine is Flexible”. Yoga benefits include reducing stress, increasing positive emotions and improving our physical body. However, we are also seeing yoga injuries on the rise as yoga has became increasingly athletic.

It is not only until I embark on my journey to become a certified fitness instructor that I realize that there is a huge
gap in my knowledge of the human body. Although yoga goes beyond the physical, most practitioners adopt a strong physical practice. So a lack of human anatomy and kinesiology in the yoga teachercould potentially cause injuries to practitioners. We can actually find <a href="http://loveyogaanatomy.com/what-are-we-actually-doing-in-asana-introducing-the-wawadia-project/" target="_blank">personal yoga anecdotes at the What Are We Actually Doing in Asana? Project</a> by Matthew Remski.

Before, we go into the 5 facts, let’s understand the structure of our spine. Our spine is made up of 4 sections: <strong>cervical spine (neck)</strong>, <strong>thoracic spine (upper back)</strong>, <strong>lumbar spine (lower back)</strong> and <strong>sacral curve (tail bone)</strong>.The spine serves as a pillar of support to our body and to protect our spinal cord. Our spines have curves as this structure enables our spines to withstand heavy stress.

Today, we will look into 5 facts about our spine that we, as yoga teachers, could use as a foundation to create a safe environment for our students.
<h2>5. Our cervical spine is the weakest part of the entire spine</h2>
Let’s start from the top, our cervical spine. Everyday, our cervical spine has to support our head, which is about 4.5 to 5 kg. Nowadays, due to modern day lifestyle, we are already putting a lot of stress on our cervical spine. A head forward-tilt position adds pressure to our cervical spine. A 15 degrees put 12 kg and 60 degrees tilt put 27kg of stress on the cervical spine¹. For every inch of forward head posture is putting at least 3 kg of stress on the cervical spine². Over time, this amount of daily stress put into our cervical spine might cause a loss of the natural curve, wear, tear, early degeneration and weakness.
<h3>Application to yoga</h3>
In yoga, the headstand and shoulder stand has been touted as the king and queen of yoga practice. In additional, there is the plough pose. When we go into these postures, we are placing tremendous stress on our cervical spine, which has been most probably weakened by modern day living. There are both benefits and risks to inversions. We should only attempt these postures after careful evaluation of the strength of the cervical spine and the risks-benefits involve.

When going into the postures, care must be taken to transfer the weight of the body away from the cervical spine. In headstand, we have to learn to use our shoulders and arms to support our weight. In shoulder stand, we can increase the surface area of the back in contact with the floor or use a blanket to reduce the flexion of the neck. I will skip the plough because I don’t think they are worth it. But the decision is yours to make.
<h2>4. Our thoracic spine should be mobile</h2>
Thoracic mobility is essential for maintaining a good posture in our daily living. A stiff thoracic spine can be inferred from an increased in the rounding of upper back, a forward head posture and possibly an increase in the lower back curve. Again, our modern day lifestyle of constant sitting can lead to this negative change. A stiff thoracic restrict the ribs joint, which in turn restrict breathing. Our bodies never work in isolation, when one region is out of balance, it will affect the other region. In the case of stiffness of the thoracic spine, the lumbar spine will come into the picture to take the role of the thoracic spine. In other words, the thoracic spine has failed to do what it is supposed to do. So, the lumbar spine has to take on the function that it is not design to be doing in order to compensate for this failure. In such event, the lumbar spine will become overwork, possibly resulting in lower back pain.
<h3>Application to yoga</h3>
Yoga is about connecting the body and the mind through the breath. So an inability to breathe deeply will reduce the calming benefits of yoga practice. There are a lot of twisting postures in yoga. In order to gain an optimal functionality of our body in the practice, we should feel the rotation more in our thoracic spine than the lumbar spine.

When students come to us, complaining about lower back pain or neck, the source of pain might be coming from the thoracic spine. Rather than asking them to do more neck or lower back exercises, we should spend some time considering the kinetic link and look into their thoracic spine. We have to get to the root of the problem in order to implement a long term However, do note that it is outside our scope of practice as yoga teachers to diagnose their cause of problems and we should refer our students to accredited professionals if required.

Next week, we will cover 3 more facts about the spine for you to plan out a more well-informed yoga classes. <strong>Stay up to date on our latest post by signing up for our newsletter.</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, we introduce you to part 1 of this series: <a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-facts-about-our-spine-for-yoga-part-1/">five facts that yoga teacher should know about the spine</a>. We touch on the cervical and thoracic spine, which are the neck and the upper back. This week, we will move on to explore another 3 exercise sciences that yoga teachers should know and refer to as a foundation of their teachings. We should always go back to the purpose of yoga to bring value to the student’s life. The original intention of yoga is not to perform at cirque du soliel. It should be a practice to maintain a healthy spine, increase awareness and increase positive feelings for the practitioners.

Here are the next 3 facts that we should know about our spine in order to prevent injuries.
<h2>3. Our lumbar spine should be stable</h2>
Our lumbar spine consists of five vertebrae, which are the largest vertebrae in the spine. The primary function of the lumbar spine is to bear the weight of the body. To allow support, we need to stiffen the muscles. While our lumbar spine can rotate, most of the rotation in our activities of daily living should be from the hips and the thoracic spine. As mentioned in last week’s article, modern day living lifestyle of prolonged seating posture has changed the way our bodies work. We are constantly in hip flexion and spine flexion, so the muscles on the back of our body: glutes, erector spinae and latissmus dorsi might be in a lengthened state. And a lengthened muscle is a weak muscle
<h3>Application to yoga</h3>
If your student has muscles at the back that are lengthened, what could be a good reason to be practicing the yoga asanas that requires forward bend, i.e. stretch the muscles at the back? We might feel good about stretching our lumbar spine in the moment because we perceive relief via the stimulation of the muscle stretch receptors. <strong>The way to ensure a healthy back is to focus on stabilizing our lumbar spine</strong>. Usually in yoga classes, we are taught to hollow our abdominal, “draw our belly button into the spine”. This movement focus on only the muscles in the front of our body. However, stabilisation of the lumbar spine is most effective when all the muscles around our abdominal are engaged. To do that, we need to move towards bracing our abdominals, creating a much greater degree of stability.

We are not saying that you should avoid all flexion activities in yoga. In fact, the cat-camel postures have been one of the exercises recommended by Dr Stuart Mcgill, the leading researcher on spinal health. We need to seek a balance and mindful approach to yoga. Rather than collapsing into a posture, which very flexible people most certainly could do, we need to engage the muscles to move our spine into a long even curve, distributing the stretch evenly and practice a variety of movements rather than doing lots of forward bend.
<h2>2. Frequent hyperextension of the lumbar spine can cause damage</h2>
As we mention above, our lumbar spine is supposed to be stable, so naturally, it mean that they are not suppose to be hyperextending. Extension of the lumbar spine occurs when we move our spine to a neutral position from a forward bend or when we lean backwards from our netural position. The safe limit of spinal compression is as recommended by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is below 3300 Newton (N). Doing exercise/asana that hyperextend your back will put your spinal compression above that safe level will increase the risk of trauma spinal compression. One such exercise or yoga asana that required hyperextension is superman/locust. It places 6000N of stress on the spine, almost twice the safe limit.
<h3>Application to yoga</h3>
In yoga, we have many backbending postures. Backbending postures invigorate and allow us to explore our body in interesting ways. <strong>A proper backbend can only be executed if one has sufficient shoulder, upper back and hips flexibility</strong>. As mentioned in point 3, our lumbar spine should be stable. Before we introduce any deep backbending asanas, we must be certain that we can engage our core muscles in the movements to prevent hyperextension.

At any point of time, we should not see a sharp change in angle in our back. This can be observed when people try to rely on the hands in upward facing dog or try to go into a deeper arch in Warrior II. It might seem like a deeper stretch, but this will cause compression in the base of the spine, jamming the two vertebrae together. Backbend should never be done by crunching the lower back but instead, it should be done by distributing the bend throughout the spine with engaged core muscles. I know the locust pose looks cool, but it is best to skip it to save your back.
<h2>1 . Our discs rehydrate overnight</h2>
In between two spinal vertebrae, there is a spinal disc. The primary function of the spinal disc is to act as a shock absorber and the inner substance of the disc is made primarily out of water. In order for the disc to function properly, it must be well hydrated. When we are awake and upright, water is slowly squeezed out of our discs. When sleeping, the unloaded disc will hydrate themselves, which is something that we want to happen. However, since the discs have increased their volume, this can make the disc more susceptible to herniation. Disc herniation mainly occurs with excessive or repeated full flexion, e.g. seated forward bend or full standing forward bend.
<h3>Application to yoga</h3>
Don’t we fantasise about the days when the ancient yogis wake up before sun rise to do sun salutations? As yoga practitioners, we try our best to honour the age old tradition, with some common sense. If you want to practice your asanas in the morning, take extra cautious, warm up amply and don’t go into the full expression of the posture. Remember yoga is about the function, not the form. When we sequence a yoga practice for the body, we can reduce the number of spinal flexion. <strong>We want to practice yoga intelligently so that it improves your physical and mental well-being</strong>. The last thing we want is for yoga to wreck our bodies, which with the wrong repetitive daily practice is not impossible. And who says yoga is only limited to yoga asanas, you could read a line of sutras or practice mindfulness, that is also a form of yoga practice.

&nbsp;

With that, we have completed our list of 5 facts about the spine that yoga teachers should know. The bottom line is to become empowered to use discernment when doing yoga. Just because it is called yoga doesn’t mean it is the right thing for your body. Question the teachings and listen to your body.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you, like me, are a fan of tribal fusion belly dance, you might have seen a few performances of backbend in the dance videos. The dance terminology that they use for backbends is called layback. It looks cool and impressive on stage and will most possibly elicit a great response from the crowd.

However, backbends should be used sparingly to protect your back. Bending backwards is not a natural movement and you should work towards it progressively with an experienced dance/gymnastic/yoga instructor, who preferably understand the anatomy and biomechanics of the body. A layback is done through hyperextending your spine. If you have been following our blog for a while, you will understand that <a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-facts-about-our-spine-for-yoga-part-2/" target="_blank">hyperextension of the back is not the safest thing to be doing</a>.

However, for the sake of art, we will give you<strong> 7 tips to perform a backbend as safe as possible in belly dancing</strong>.
<h2>7. Engage your core</h2>
You need a strong back to get into this pose. Don't go into the backbend by fold from your lower back first. As you are preparing to bend backwards from your standing position, engage your core by bracing them. Then you extend your torso backwards. Remember, no crunching of the lower back. If you look at the photo, my back is generally a smooth curve. Unless you are contortionist with lax ligaments, your lower back will scream if you ever try to fold it directly from there.
<h2>6. Ground those feet</h2>
As with powerlifting, you should have a stable base. <strong>This is done by having a tripod base of support in the feet</strong>. The three points are the mid foot of the heels, the joint at the base of the big toe and the small toe. This will promote balance and stability. It will also engage your leg muscles more so as to prevent the caving in of the knees.
<h2>5. Initiate the movement from the hips.</h2>
If I were to point out one place which the “folding” occurs, I will say it occurs at the hip. Just like squats, you move with the hips. Engage the core and move your hips forward. Now is a good time to activate your glute muscles.
<h2>4. Maintain a neutral spine as much as possible</h2>
Neutral spine is the natural alignment of your spine, with all the 3 curves of the spine in good alignment. Your back of the head, shoulder blades and hips should be aligned in the initial part of the movement. It is inevitable that you will go into hyperextension in the full expression of this posture, however, keep in mind that you want to avoid crunching the lower back.
<h2>3. Allow the knees to go past the feet</h2>
To maintain your balance, your knees will naturally move forward. This helps to take the load off your spine. As your knees move forward, you will be back bending closer to the ground. This helps to keep your center of gravity low, so that you are more stable and experience less shearing force on the spine.
<h2>2. Go slow</h2>
You have a stretch reflex to consider. When the muscles are being stretch too quickly, a stretch reflex will kick in and your backbend will be jam at some point. If you go too fast, chances are you might not be addressing the points mention before. Unless, you are doing a Turkish drop, go slowly into this posture. Usually laybacks are done with slow and sensual rhythm, so you should just go with the music.
<h2>1. Stop practicing backbend like crazy at home</h2>
If you have been performing lots of bow pose and camel, hoping to get into to get into this pose sooner, stop. Nope, I didn't do too much of back bends. There is a failure tolerant in your muscle. <strong>Once you exceed this point of failure tolerant, you will be doing damage to your body.</strong> In order to do a backbend, you need to think along the line of building your upper back flexibility, lower back stability, core strength, hips stability and flexibility, abductors/adductors strength, quadriceps flexibility and ankle strength. Address all these points first before moving into a backbend. Over here, I like to apply weight training practice, give your body adequate rest from all the intense backbend in order for it to adapt to the demands and become stronger.

&nbsp;

That’s it for our seven tips for a safe backbends. Do you have any more pointers to add? <strong>Let us know in the comment section below.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Are you falling for these 4 myths on the juice fast people?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love juices. I love the taste of it. I’m not going to lie, I drink juices from the carton because it is convenient. By juicing, you can get a fast supply of vitamins and minerals. We all know that vegetables and fruits are good for health.

According to Health Promotion Board, we are supposed to be consuming at least 2 servings of fruit and 2 servings of vegetables every day. A diet rich in fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.

As a vegetarian, I’m fully supportive of people consuming more vegetables and fruits. I have met vegetarians who cleanse frequently and hold these cleanses highly. But before we set the determination to embark on a three day, five day or seven day juice only cleanse based on what we hear, we need to be aware that there are many myths that are going around regarding juice cleansing. Today, we are going to debunk 4 of them.
<h2>1. Juice fast will detox your body</h2>
One of the most common belief is that a juice fast will “detox” or cleanse your body of toxins. The truth is, our liver, kidneys and intestine are already doing this, filtering the unwanted things that we ingest and expelling them through the form of urine, bowel, breath and sweat. And to prove that we can rid our bodies of toxins by juicing, we need to first identify the toxins and take a measurement of the level of the toxin before and after juicing. Up to date, I have never heard of anyone claiming that juice cleanse can reduce dioxins, phthalates or arsenic.
<h2>2. Juice fast can get your body to work better</h2>
Some people believe juicing makes you feel more energetic and you can improve your bodily system. Sometimes, when I eat less, I do feel more energetic because my energy is not all expended on digesting. However, I was still eating food, just noticeably lesser. In fact, a juice only cleanse are usually low in protein, fat and fiber. As such, these cleanses will be leaving out critical nutrients in your body, getting your body to absorb more fructose sugar directly. Other than the fact that they will supply our body with a range of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, an extended juice fasting might be creating more havoc in our body than making it work better.
<h2>3. You can lose weight on juice fast</h2>
Yes, you will lose weight initially, because your calorie intake is so low. However, the weight that you lose might just be water weight. Losing water weight might come at the expense of muscle loss. When we are looking to lose weight, we should strive to lose fat and not our lean muscles. Losing our muscles will lower the metabolism. For someone who is looking to lose weight permanently, it is still better to work towards having more lean muscles and lesser fats for the long run.
<h2>4. A seven day juice cleanse can offset a year of unhealthy eating</h2>
This tied back to our first point about detoxification through juicing. Somehow, we love to buy into this idea that there is going to be this one exercise plan that make us skinny or ripped, there is this one supplement that make our skin glows, this one medication that will cure us. We have been trained by marketers that there is a one magic pill for everything in life. We think that a seven day juice cleanse is sufficient to erase the rubbish we put into our body for the remaining three hundred plus days. Undeniably, the role of nutrition is important in ensuring that waste doesn’t build up excessively in our body. This is maintained through a clean diet, sufficient fruits and vegetables and proper hydration and not through some magic potion of blended fruits and vegetables.

So is juicing bad? To me, yes, if you are doing a juice fasting. However, this post is not to discourage you from juicing. Juices, as a complement to a well balanced diet, will help to increase our nutrients intake and it is a natural answer to our need for sugar. In fact, I want to applaud you for setting the determination to take a step towards healthy living. However, it is vital that we stop portraying healthy living as a punishing behavior, be it fasting, eating cardboard like food or drinking pee. Healthy living should be about empowerment and energy. So go ahead, get your juices. I’m just going to skip the expensive cleanses and enjoy my freshly pressed juice with my meal.

		<title>Can yoga help in weight loss? 5 facts you need to know</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a yoga teacher, I wish that yoga can help you to detox, lose weight, tone your muscles, save your marriage, improve your fertility, improve your eyesight and so on. But sometimes, these claims can be a bit farfetched. As a yoga teacher, I am continually making discoveries on how yoga works in the subtle field. I can tell you, yoga changes my life, it brings clarity, joy and contentment. I am more grounded and happier after I discover yoga. Yoga teaches me that even though there are still many things in my life that I have to work towards, I am, in this moment, enough. We all know yoga brings a lot of mental benefits to us. But the question is, can yoga help us to lose weight?

Today we will explore the 5 facts that will better inform you on how to manage your weight better through yoga.
<h2>5. Weight loss is more about the food you eat than the exercise you do</h2>
Weight loss occurs when the calories you burn out exceeds the calories you consume, putting yourself in negative energy balance, thus losing weight. A hatha yoga, stretch class for 30 minutes, burns 120 calories. Running at 8.4km/h for 30 minutes burns 270 calories. To put that into perspective, to lose 1 kg of weight, you must cut out 7700 calories. If you eliminate 550 calories per day, you will lose about 0.5kg per week. A subway chocolate chip cookie is 220 calories. Calories in a McDonald’s apple pie is 250 calories. From this numbers, it would make sense that it is a whole lot less work to focus on putting less calories than trying to burn them.
<h2>4. Yoga improve mindfulness</h2>
The main difference of yoga from other forms of exercise is the mindfulness aspect. Some teachers will recite meaningful phrases, some will integrate mindfulness through your breath and others will ask you to observe your thoughts during the yoga sessions. Regardless of what techniques the yoga teacher use, the main focus of yoga class is for you to become more aware of your internal dialogue and physical sensations. This sense of mindfulness and awareness during the yoga session will cross over to real life whereby you will become more aware of your body sensation. When we step into the kitchen or pantry, and before we reach out for another cookie or snack, we can use this awareness to tune into our bodies to check if we are eating out of boredom or hunger.<strong> Remember, the less calories you ingest, the more calories you have cut out from your diet and the less calories you need to burn.</strong>
<h2>3. You start treating your body like a temple</h2>
Once, somebody ask me how can yoga help in weight loss? My first reaction is that yoga helps us to become more aware in our lives and we start to make decisions that are healthy and meaningful to us. At the most basic physiological level, that will mean becoming more aware of the food that we put into our body. Refined sugar and white flour are two of the main culprits in weight gain in modern day living. They are food-like substances that wrecked our body mechanisms, causing weight gain by interfering with our hormones.

High intake of sugar can cause insulin resistance, which can in turn trigger leptin resistance. Leptin is the hormone that signal to your brain that you are full. <strong>When you become leptin resistant, your brain doesn’t give you signals of being full, so you overeat.</strong> Being overweight could be due to our hormones. And certain hormones, like insulin and leptin are being influenced by our diet. Through yoga, we could make an easier transition to start treating our body more like a temple and less like a graveyard of junk food. Clean and healthy food makes us feel better. Yoga makes us more mindful of our body sensations and we remember how sugary and high fat food causes our energy to fluctuate and how healthy food provides us with a constant stream of energy. This is how our yoga practices translate in our daily life to make healthy decision.
<h2>2. Yoga helps us to manage stress</h2>
Another hormone that can contribute to obesity is cortisol. Cortisol is the hormone that is released when we are feeling stressed. We need cortisol in our daily functioning. However, modern day living of being constantly exposed to stress have caused cortisol to be in excess. Cortisol increases the flow of glucose to tissue and bloodstream, providing us with short-term energy boost in order to “fight-or-flight” from a stressful event. However, modern stressors come more from traffic jams or bills, which we no longer expend energy to survive it.<strong> Since we are not burning the energy, our bodies now have excess energy that it has to deal with.</strong> All this additional energy simply gets stored as fat. Yoga teaches us to manage ourselves better when dealing with our daily stressor. As we see from the hormonal chain triggers off by feeling stress, this benefit could go beyond the mental and assist us in managing our weight.
<h2>1. Yoga can be a form of strength training</h2>
So far, we have spoken about the internal changes that occur to assist us in losing weight through yoga. But how about yoga as physical practice, how does it help in managing our weight? <strong>Yoga is a form of body weight exercise, which can help us to build muscles.</strong> A warrior pose build our legs and back muscles. Inversion and arm balance helps to tone our full body. Yoga can be effectively a strength training which you use your own body as a form of resistance. Muscles have a slightly higher metabolic rate than fats. So the practice of asanas could help us to manage our weight but it will dependson the style that we practice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the term meditation comes into mind, some people will still conjure up images of people sitting in lotus position, hands in some kind of mudra, sitting motionlessly on a cushion.

Luckily, science is catching up with this ancient practice in validating the practicalities of meditation. The benefits of meditation are that it improves awareness, mindfulness and focus: basically the skills that you should bring over to your day to day living. Other health benefits include lowering your blood pressure and improving your immune system. It also helps to reduce stress.¹

Nowadays, we are living in a fast paced society which honours the people with type A personalities. We are expected to produce results fast. Our workplaces are constantly coming up with ideas to improve our productivity and efficiency. All this can feel like we are heading towards a 51m waterfall.
<h2>The ninja mindfulness technique</h2>
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could access to this mindfulness as and when we are feeling a little bit of steam in our heads?

What if you can access this state of mindfulness at your workplace, or any other stressful situations quickly without people noticing?
<h2>The best part, achieving it in 30 seconds.</h2>
In my yoga teacher training program, we are taught that the breath connects the body and the mind. That is why the practice of yoga emphasizes so much on breathing.

Firstly, it enables our bodily movement to synchronize with the movements of our internal organs, lungs and diaphragm. Secondly, when we are doing the movements without the awareness of the breath, we might slip into automation during the repetition of the sequences. <strong>When we focus on our breath, we become fully present to both the internal and physical aspect of ourselves.</strong>

With this principle in mind, our 30 second mindfulness technique will connect your body, mind and actions. I often use this technique before I start teaching classes and tackling a challenging task on hand. It makes me more grounded and ready for the incoming activity.

<strong>1. Inhale and exhale deeply and gently for the first two breaths </strong>
<strong>2. Focus on your bodily sensations.</strong> If you feel any tension in your body, you could move it or stretch it to remove the tension. Usually, we will feel tension in our back and neck.
<strong>3. Repeat your mantra, or personal vision/quality internally.</strong> E.g. For now I feel ____ : peace, confidence or grace.
<strong>4. Inhale deeply, feeling the quality of your desired quality in your entire being. </strong>Sometimes you might even feel some sensations along your body, just like when you imagine there is a big spider on your hand and you get a sensation along your hand.<strong> Exhale deeply, just be there for the moment, becoming aware of your bodily presence. </strong>
<strong>5. Smile.</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is 7.30 in the morning. The juvenile macaque watches over us nearby, inviting us to take photos of him. His yellow eyes follow every gesture that might be a suggestion of something being pulled up of the bag.

“When the monkeys attack people, it is usually the people fault. When people start feeding the monkeys, the monkeys will start to associate people with food. Over time, this might escalate to aggressive behavior.”

570 macaques, which are about one-third of the population of macaques are being culled in 2013 on the basis that there are increased cases of human-monkey conflict. It soon moved on to a discussion of another human-nature conflict: <strong>plans of constructing a Cross Island MRT Line beneath our beloved Central Catchment Nature Reserve and MacRitchie Reservoir</strong>.

If such endeavors are to be rolled out as plan, our biodiversity and nature reserve will be drastically impacted. One can’t simply plant a tree for every tree that is cut down in the forest and say that it will still be the same. The biodiversity, the fungi, the insects, the microbes and all kind of lives that thrive in the forest are not replaceable by artificial parks. <strong>It takes a long time for such diversity to be developed.</strong>
<h2>Life lessons from nature</h2>
Our lives are not merely dictated by endless economic pursuits. <strong>Nature is a vital part of our lives.</strong> Besides regulating the climate, providing homes to many species, improving water, soil and air quality, our nature reserves impart great lessons to our lives.
<h2>7. There will be a beginning and an end</h2>
When we first step into the forest, a tree beside the pathway has fallen. On the other side of the pathway, there is a seedling sprouting off the ground. In our life, there will be separation, reunion, death, newborn, sadness and happiness. This is part of nature. When the going gets tough, we have to keep the faith that our efforts will bring our misfortune to an end and there will be a better future to fight for. Similarly, when things are getting lucky for you, pass it forward and help others because you can never predict when it will end.
<h2>6. Everything is a cycle</h2>
Though the lifespan of the tree ended when it falls, other species will thrive in its’ place. Fungi commonly feed on dead log. Carpenter bees burrow into dead trees for nesting. We have very limited time on earth but our work or our life stories often outlived us. What is the value that you want to create while you are here? <strong>What is the legacy that you wish to impart for the future generations?</strong>
<h2>5. Engage in cooperative relationships</h2>
The Common Mahang is often seen in Singapore secondary rainforest. This plant has a obligatory relationship with the heart gaster ants. The plant provides food and shelter for the ants. In return, the ants provide the plant with protection against herbivores, insects and pathogenic fungi.¹ No man is an island. <strong>Learn to leverage on the strength of your partners and provide a mutual benefit in order to bring you and your partners to a greater height.</strong>
<h2>4. There is strength in number</h2>
We spot a cluster of caterpillars on two of the leaves. Different species of caterpillars have different ways of defending themselves. Some are brightly colored, some camouflage and some other group together. The cluster of caterpillar are not randomly located, rather, they bunch up together neatly, side by side, to feed on the leaves. Our guide says that this might increase the chances of survival of an individual when they are in a group. <strong>When we work together, we become less vulnerable and stronger as a unit.</strong>
<h2>3. The young needs protection</h2>
It is most fortunate that we are able to spot a colugo with her pup hanging on a trunk. From time to time, the pup will pop up its’ head from the protection of its’ mum. Remember the seedling that we talk about in the beginning of the article? Our guide says that seedlings are very delicate, they need shelter from the mature trees to grow. When we are starting a new habit, business or partnership, it is akin to nurturing the young. It will take us some time to develop them. There will be some good days and some backslides. This is the journey we have chosen. <strong>So we might as well learn to be patient with ourselves while nurturing our dreams instead of stifling it too early by constant negative self criticism.</strong>
<h2>2. Vanity has its place but we shouldn’t get attached to it</h2>
Birds are beautiful, they come in all shades of colors, sizes and shapes. The male needs the beauty to attract the female. One species that we spot is the greater racket-tailed drongo. Racket-tailed because they have 2 long rackets as their tails. No one can say for certain what the racket tails are used for. But sometimes they lose the tail and it doesn’t grow back. While we shouldn’t judge a person by his/her appearance, it is difficult to not make assumptions based on the appearance. When we are working, we should look professional. On the other hand, I know of ladies (and even men) who are disappointed with the process of ageing. Ageing is part of nature, we have to be mindful that our appearances change with time and <strong>we should remind ourselves to accept such changes with grace.</strong>
<h2>1. Not all activities will have an obvious immediate result</h2>
The thing about nature is that everything takes time. Although the preservation of the forest doesn’t seem to be linked to immediate economic gains, it still holds a very important role in our society. Being in nature reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. It also contributes to the physical well being.² At the fundamental levels, it imbues a level of connection within people and between people and the environment. There are many ways that a person could climb the ladder of success. <strong>One thing to bear in mind is that while short term monetary gain might bring in more economic benefits in a short period of time, a long term mutual relationship might haul in more beneficial results in the long run.</strong>

		<title>5 effective ways to mindful eating</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you struggle with food too? I have.

With so much food around us, I know how difficult it can be to make a choice.

I was a binger, a comfort eater and a nibbler at various parts of my life. And I work in an organic cafe where I’m constantly surrounded with food. <strong>Growing up, I ate four big meals. And I stop only when I feel bloated</strong>. But since I was growing, my weight did not fluctuate out of control. While that might be a good thing, but I never learn to listen to my body. And the usual bad habits: skipping my meals, having long time gap between meals, munching constantly and wolfing down food. Been there, done that.

We are living in an era where we have no lack of food. More than that, we are bombarded with choices that are calories dense, high in sugar, high in fats, high in salt and contain trans fat. We are facing an epidemic of obesity, and a rise in rich men disease: high blood pressure, heart attack and diabetes.
<h2>Mindful eating</h2>
<strong>It’s true that we are what we eat and how we eat.</strong>

We can choose to suffer from the consequences of our poor choice of diet or flourish with our healthy eating habits.

<strong>Being mindful of that is our first key to change.</strong>

Just a few months ago, I start to look at my own physique. I am exercising frequently and eating healthily, but my body fats remain. My BMI is in the healthy range and I don’t look fat. But I have a belly. It is only after reading up on fat loss that make me become more mindful about my eating habits. Outwardly, I have a very healthy relationship with food: vegetarianism, little junk food, little sugar, organic produce. But I’m overeating due to the fact that I’m eating too quickly. For me, the change can be implemented quickly. Within 29 days, I’m seeing results from my mindful eating.

Today, I’m going to share my 5 tips with you.
<h1>5. Tune into your body before eating</h1>
<strong> “Why do I eat?”</strong> Taking a pause before I reach out to my favorite cashew nuts (and the next, and the next, before I know it I must have consumed 500 calories worth of nuts) helps me to tune into my body. Do I eat because I’m bored? Or does my body really need the nourishment?

Sometimes when we feel hunger, we are actually dehydrated. Our brain can get confused over these two. So hydrate yourself if you are feeling hungry. If you feel satisfied after drinking, chances are you are just thirsty.

If after drinking and you still feel hungry but it is not your meal time yet, <strong>take small servings on your plate so that you could keep tuning into your body after each bite.</strong> I know I can’t resist the bottle of cashew nuts right in front of me. So I will pick up five to six nuts and slowly savour them in the living room.
<h1>2. Don’t allow yourself to starve</h1>
The previous point addresses the issue of overeating. This point emphasizes on not depriving your body. <strong>When we become too hungry, we tend to gorge down our food.</strong> This creates a tendency of overeating. Our brain and body register fullness in about 20 to 30 minutes. If we are finishing our meal before that period of time, there might be a chance that we will overeat.
<h1>3. Savour each bite</h1>
If you are like me, a fast eater, you tend to find yourself finishing your meal under 20 minutes. Becoming more mindful of each chew will help. Avoid eating with TV, smartphones, computer or anything that could steal your focus away from your food. People are of course excluded. We tend to chat when dining in social environment, and thus spending a longer time on our meal. However, be aware, being in a social situation might result in us overeating.

<strong>Try this practice: take a bite, put down the utensils and become mindful of the food in your mouth.</strong>

Can you taste the nuances of the flavours? Does it melt? Does it leave an aromatic aftertaste? If you chew longer, you could enjoy the sensory delight for a longer time. Chew well. Chew until your food is liquefied or lost its texture
<h1>4. Plan your meals</h1>
Planning your meal doesn’t mean tedious calories calculation for each meal.<strong> It could just be something as simple as making the resolution to eat clean and at regulated timing.</strong> If you prepare your own meal at home, you won’t need to wrestle your willpower to over salad or pizza. You automate your choice of food and remove a lot of distractions.

Have you ever experience spending an hour in social media only to feel guilty of how much time you have wasted not spending clearing your mountain of work? This could be due to a lack of plan. If you have plan your day on 90 minutes work and 15 minutes rest block, you find yourself sticking to the plan much better.

Similarly, for your meals, once you have a plan, it will become easier to stick to healthy eating.
<h1>5. Make use of tools</h1>
In order to ensure you have a smooth transition to mindful and healthy eating, make use of all the available tools in the beginning. Use your non-dominate hand to eat to slow down your pace. Use chopstick instead of fork and spoon.

If you are still having a hard time to eat mindfully, you could check out <a href="https://www.hapi.com/product/hapifork" target="_blank">HAPIfork</a>. It monitors and tracks your eating habit. And also send you a gentle vibration and light up when you are eating too quickly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Can mindfulness work for you? Have you ever find yourself contemplating about learning to become mindful? Or are you still on the fence, waiting for more research papers to be published and more people to practice mindfulness before considering being part of the mindful group? Or are you simply wondering what the term mindfulness is?

Gone are the days when mindfulness is an esoteric term that stems from eastern spiritual practice. Big names like Apple, Google, Nike and HBO are spearheading the effort to promote mindfulness to their employees¹.
<h2><strong>Mindfulness means to be fully in the “here and now”.</strong></h2>
It means becoming aware of our environment and our internal thoughts, emotions and behaviors.

It means taking a step back to view things with better clarity and non-judgment.

It means making better decisions at the point of time.

<strong>Are you thinking, “Basically, you mean to say yoga, meditation, mind-body and/or mindfulness class can help us to become a better version of ourselves?”</strong>
<h2><strong>Yes, it can!</strong></h2>
You already know how <a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-effective-ways-to-start-eating-mindfully/">mindfulness can help us to lose weight</a>. So now, we are going to discuss 5 ways being mindful can help us at work.
<h2>5. Reduce stress</h2>
The deadlines, rushing from places to places, traffic jams, pressure from the management. How often do our minds fleet from one to-do to the next task in hand? No wonder so many of us are under constant stress.

By being in the moment, you reduce the tendency of your mind to go back into the past and the future. Thinking about the past might induce regrets. Thinking about the future might increase the tendency of worries. And projecting pass failures or gloomy scenarios on future uncertainties might cause fear. <strong>When you are mindful of the moment, you become aware of the challenges ahead without allow yourself to become overwhelm by it.</strong>
<h2>4. Manage your emotions better</h2>
Ever feel angry with an unreasonable request in work? Ever feel wrongly accused? As human, we have a lot of thoughts and emotion, for example, fear, regrets, worries and anxiety. Sometimes, we allow these strong emotions to control our thoughts, which then in turn will control us. Then, we automatically follow them such pattern as it becomes our habitual reactive patterns.

With mindfulness, we start to become aware of such emotions and thoughts. <strong>While such emotions and thoughts are our natural processes, we can learn to choose to not be affected by it.</strong> Over time, we will build up a higher level of tolerance for unpleasant emotions and thoughts. We will no longer be controlled by our thoughts and emotions but are instead able to use them as information in an objective manner and respond to the situation in hand.
<h2>3. Build better social relationships</h2>
In any workplace, we will have to deal with people, be it colleagues, supervisors, vendors or customers. Sometimes miscommunication might arise. Other time, anger, pride and politics can come in between the cohesion of people. In business, people and relationship play a vital role.

The practice of mindfulness increases our empathy and compassion towards others through growing our own source of inner joy. Like a cup brimming with water, when you have so much joy in yourself, it cannot be helped but to overflow to others. <strong>Being present and paying full attention in conversations make the other party feel appreciated, thus creating a mutual positive relationship.</strong>
<h2>2. Increase your productivity</h2>
Nowadays people have a full list of to do list. Work can never end and time always seems to be insufficient. I’m a freelancer (also playing many roles of part-timers to make ends meet). So I know how social media and procrastination could affect the output of my workload and the amount of money I earn. Time management is a tool that I have to learn fast.

Fifteen minutes of social media time quickly escalate to one hour if we are not aware. Forget multi-tasking, they are alright for low-attention jobs. However, if your task at hand requires high-attention, you need to learn to focus and grind at it in scheduled block of time. <strong>Mindfulness practices require us to focus on one thing at a thing.</strong> This practice could be effectively transfer to our work. See your productivity level increase after you apply mindfulness work habits.
<h2>1. Improve your well-being</h2>
Sick days are costly to the company. The company has to pay in term of wages to the sick employees, replacement workers, reduce productivity and possible reduce morale in other workers. As a valuable employee of the company, you want to minimise such hidden costs to your employer.

It is known that our mind and body are connected. When our minds are unwell, it will manifest in our bodies. Or if we are upset constantly, our work will be affected. <strong>Mindfulness has been recorded to enhance our well-being.</strong> One way of putting it is that the practice of mindfulness restores ourselves to our wholeness. As they say, a happy worker is a productive worker.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am the zen girl. Nobody has seen me flare up.

I mean really nobody, at least, not since I take up yoga.

I am able to regulate my emotions well, even in stressful and fast-paced environment, like a commercial kitchen. <strong>But this week I experience an emotional hijack.</strong>

One of my close friends pulls an MIA act. We are supposed to meet on that day and he did not reply to my message. Not in the morning and not even in the afternoon.

<strong>Disappointment and anger consume me at that moment.</strong>

I check my phone constantly, hoping to receive some news. The more I check my phone, the more intense the feeling becomes. The more the feeling intensifies the more I check my phone.

I couldn’t focus on my work. All I could do is to check my phone and spend time doing frivolous activities.

I am edgy, distracted, frustrated and disappointed. Most importantly, my mind starts wandering from one negative scenario to the next. I start to think of sarcastic retorts if he replies. And then it all spiral downwards from there.

<strong>Until, I take a step back.</strong>

Until it comes to me that I have allowed my emotions to get the best of me.

Until I realize that I just destroying myself by allowing such atrocities in my mind. I’m not helping myself by thinking of the different aspect of negativity of the situation. I’m feeding on my demons.

At the end, It turns out that my friend is so tired that he sleeps for 18 hours straight. Honestly, who is able to do that unless they are drained? We arrange to meet up on the next day and we still have a blast.

After meeting him, I find myself charged for my future challenges. If I have allowed myself to jump to assumptions, I wouldn’t have the opportunity to spend a great morning with someone who has always inspires and motivates me to be a better version of myself.
<h2>Regulate your emotions</h2>
I am able to regulate my emotions because I take <strong>5 minutes to practice mindfulness meditation.</strong> I’m going to share it with you so that you could practice it whenever you feel overwhelm by your emotions and start to let negativity get hold of you.
<h2>Pause</h2>
Become aware of your thoughts, sensations and emotions. Allow yourself to tune into your inner world without judgment, even if they are negative, for at least ten seconds. Observe your thoughts and emotions.

<em>Once I find myself overwhelmed, I stop whatever I am doing and start tuning into my body by becoming an observer. Think a person on a platform watching the train passes.</em>
<h2>Analyse your feelings</h2>
Describe them, are you feeling angry, frustrated or upset. Understand your feelings. Are they rational or are they products of your imagination? Are they vital in assisting you to make a wise choice? Or will they most likely distort your decision-making process? E.g. it is natural to feel stress when you are head on with a snake, this fear is required for you to save your life. However, feeling stressed up in a traffic jam will cause adrenaline build up, resulting in an adverse effect on your health.

<em>I am feeling a sense of worthlessness. Maybe I am not worth his time. A sense of disappointment. Why did he not act as he has promised? And I start to think that we will probably not meet again. He probably finds me too boring and will rather spend his time somewhere else. </em>
<em>Then it occurs to me that if that is the case, he will not have contacted me in the first place. The previous scenarios that I have been thinking are by far products of my own imagination and are unverifiable.</em>
<h2>Stay in the moment</h2>
Practice focused breathing meditation. Notice your emotions again. Are they ebbing off naturally or are you trying to suppress them? Allow your emotions to guide you. Keep analyzing your feelings to be able to effectively take a step back from the emotional waterfall.
<h2>Brainstorm on your options</h2>
You could come up with more than two. Then think of the possible consequences of each action. And take action accordingly. Yes, I’m telling you that you could have the option of acting on your emotions but only if you determine that it is for the best.

<em>I could react angrily when he replies, make him feels guilty. When we meet, it might be awkward. After the meeting, we might risk not being friends again. </em>
<em>Or I can respond calmly, meet up with him and give him an opportunity to explain himself. At the same time, I could let him know that my time is valuable and I hope that he will respect my boundaries. We will still be able to be friends, and our friendship might grow even stronger because it is based on trust and not on guilt.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is not uncommon for us to accumulate.
Papers, ranks, money, items, memories,
tears, smiles, joys and separations.

We come to this earth, they say to love.
While some say that we are here to clear our sins.
There are others who never really give a damn.

It’s a mystery still, this dance of life.
A cowardice. An act. Or maybe a pretense.
If we all live the life only the way we think it ought to be.

To fit in the narrow hole, as if
we are all Alices, meant to jump in the rabbit hole,
leading to a long slide down to our wonderland.

“Off with his head.” Should one err on things too swift.
Perhaps so, we keep toeing and running, and we keep
keeping up on time, only to run out over and over.

Things that should be.
Don’t deviate. Don’t ruffle. Don't think.
Then maybe, we’ll be granted safety and security.

“It’s very easy to take more than nothing.”
Where do we begin and where do things end?
“Who in the world am I?” The greatest puzzle in the world.

We could go on and on, without knowing where to head.
But it takes us, within us to realize we
are all different and we still are very much
our muchness, muchier than much.

We could learn to breathe, and go along
with these madness, remaining curiouser.
Learn to let go of our non-sense to make sense.

To breathe, let go and be here now.
Now: the only thing that the watch will say.
And that, could have set us all free.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Zombies, vampire, soul bearer, ghost and demons all gather in town on 7 November for a good reason.

They are here to raise funds for the <a href="http://www.catwelfare.org" target="_blank">Cat Welfare Society</a> through a 1½ hour show.
<h2>Monsters' Bash.</h2>
Cat Welfare Society is a charity that aims to promote a humane, responsible and informed society in Singapore where cats are cared for responsibly as pets and treated with kindness as community cats.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Monsters-Bash-1476993025962945/" target="_blank">Monsters' Bash</a> is an event organised by my 2 friends and I. We aim to raise awareness regarding the welfare of the street cats and to provide a platform for artists to showcase their dedication to arts.

The monsters put together an unique halloween-themed dance pieces. Besides having performances, the monsters gather for an interactive session of monsters' walk, spooking the guests who dare to enter the chamber of monstrosity. There are also talented henna and makeup artists on site to monstify the guests.

After months of planning their first event, the three monsters' instigators manage to wrap up the event with an amount of <strong>$550.40 raised for Cat Welfare Society</strong>. For now, all the monsters have returned to their dungeons and grottos. Till the next time they spook you, don't let your guard down.

In the meantime, keep a lookout on this space for more meaningful and alternative events.

		<title>An important life lesson from 1 burn, 2 fractured bones and 3 lacerations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>24 Novmeber 2015. I crash.</strong></h1>
And need stitches on 3 parts of my body: the left elbow, side of my left thigh and my left knee.

I am in Bali, with plans to climb Mt Agung, Bali’s highest mountain, an elevation of 3031m, on that evening. Now, it won't be happening.

9.47am, I have 3 gaping wounds, some scratches and a limp. It is my 3rd day of travel, I have a total of 7 days in Bali.

On my 3rd day, I am lying on the bed of the 3rd hospital they send me to. Local anesthesia is injected around my wounds. At 12.08pm, I am in stitches and bandages.

I could have felt bad for myself. But I smile and tell everyone else that all is fine and gracefully accept any help that come my way.

The next 4 days, I treat myself to lots of organic food and ice cream.

And on my 6th day, I am given an opportunity to teach a short English class in a local village school.

I did not rush off from plans to plans, places to places. It is a slow holiday. Every morning, I relax at my hostel, Rama Sita, which overlooks beautiful stretches of rice field. When there is someone in the hostel, I enjoy their company. When there is no one around, I rejoice in the silence and peace.

It is not the first time that something major happen to my body. At 19, I have 2 incidents of fractured right collar bones. At 23, I have a 2-inch burn on my left leg from the motor exhaust pipe during my travel.

I could have been upset over my negligence. I could have chosen to focus on the pain that I have brought upon myself over and over.
<h1><strong>But I choose to be grateful.</strong></h1>
Grateful that things did not turn out worse. Grateful that I can choose to smile. I will not allow myself to be miserable despite my circumstances.

In the end, things turn out well. Because of my fracture, I am able to attend an exchange program in school. Otherwise, I will have to remain in my internship, which I’m not enjoying. Because of my burnt mark, I have a great ice breaker story. Because of my recent accident, I am treated with kindness and unexpected surprises.

The scars will probably remain for a long time on my body as a reminder to be more cautious. But I won’t let them constrict me. They will not stop me from being in the moment that I am in. If I am to feel grieve, I will stay in that moment. If I am to feel joy, I will too stay in that moment. Whatever may come, I see them as valuable experiences and life lessons.

Unexpected events happen. Changes are common. Often time, we might feel safer living in the constant and frazzled over changes. But it is up to us to be affected negatively or positively by them.
<h1>This is resilience. And this is the life lesson I receive.</h1>
I learn to allow myself to blossom to rise above my current adversity. I learn that It is about managing my behaviors, thoughts and actions. It is about processing my emotional distress. It is about managing them so that they don’t stop me from normal functioning.

We are all human, we will feel strong emotions should adversity or trauma arises. Being resilient won’t make the problems go away. But being resilient will enhance our abilities to handle them more effectively. We can choose to bounce back or to fall apart.

In my life, I choose to bounce back, no matter how hard I fall. Sometimes, I will stay a long time in my fall, but I will definitely rise again.
<h1>Because this moment is the only time I have.</h1>
And I will choose to make the best out of it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Motivational Read for 25-Year-Old</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>25.</h1>
<h1>Life.</h1>
Encounters of cheats and scam artists. Failures, disappointments and scorn. Because of those, you might have grown a little skeptical. Your world of dreams might have shrunk a little. You know there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It hurts more when you learn that the end of the rainbow is nothing but an optical illusion.
<h1>Intersection.</h1>
Adventures, love and dreams. And hopefully more tales to come. You are at the peak of your young adulthood. 4 years ago, you officially become an adult, you become legal in the eyes of justice. 5 more years, you are going into your big 3. Maybe the world isn’t so hostile after all. You manage to meet helpful strangers, who become friends. If you are fortunate enough, you might too have found your soul mate.

Do you still remember how it is like for you 10 years back? When you are still a teen? When you look to the adults and think to yourself how they seem to have it all. No homework, no exams, no deadlines. Glitz and glam. Holidays and cruise. Photos to show it all off. And money to spend on things that they like.
<h1>Questions.</h1>
How is it like for you now? Back to your reality. Now, you are at where they are, 25. Maybe you still do not have your life together. But you get a glimpse to the social issues: economic crisis, inequality, prejudices and political unrest. You remember saying that you are going to change the world and make the world a better place. You are younger then and you hold wild ambitions.

Perhaps now, at the age of 25, you still do not have any clear directions on how to achieve that. But you know better. You know that not knowing could be more of the norm. By 25, you meet mentors and people of different age group and you realise it is common for people to not have a clue on what is going on with their lives.

But it’s okay, you're only 25. Your commitments are rising but hopefully you're out of debt. Maybe you've been bumming around for the past 25 years. However, you can still make the choice to pick things up over the next 25 years.

You need to make the decision now. You don’t have time to waste.
<h1>You only have this moment. Now.</h1>
If you have yet to do so, now is the time to live so hard that you don’t look back in regrets. Wake up everyday and choose to hustle. You might not know exactly what your purpose in life is yet. But just keep working on it, grab opportunities as they come. You never know when you will chance upon your calling, so don’t avoid the toil.

Your purpose won’t fall from the sky if all you do is to talk about it. Go far and go broad in search of it. When you find it, stay on it with laser-like focus. Sometimes it is not about following your heart, it is about recognizing the potential in the path.

There are possibilities and opportunities to explore. You might end up on the wrong side of the path but allow these experiences to make you stronger and kinder. Do good, create, try new things, be open to love, reflect at the end of the day and talk to strangers. Experiment with a new recipe, watch a documentary, fall asleep under the stars and volunteer for a cause.

You are 25. Some people never live to that age.

It is great just to be alive.
<h1>Today is a great time to create your life.</h1>
<p style="text-align: right;">Now, do that every single day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>5 reasons a healthy self-esteem is crucial in your weight management program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="mceTemp"></div>
When I first embark on my 15 weeks to fat loss program, I didn’t know what will transpire. I am never overweight, but I feel that as a fitness instructor, I need to look more toned and muscular.

I want to lead by example through my own body.

During my 15 weeks program, I try a few things: counting my calories, timing my food intake, having smoothie for breakfast and exercising intensely.

Then in the middle of my experiment, I allow myself some junk food. I stop counting my calories and allow my body to guide me.

It still works.

At the end of my experiment, I look more toned. And I realize a crucial factor in the success of my program lies in my <strong>self-esteem</strong>.
<h2>What exactly is self-esteem?</h2>
Self-esteem is our overall opinion of ourselves – how we feel about our abilities and limitations. A healthy self-esteem makes us feel good about ourselves realistically, promotes good body image and self-respect. A low self-esteem makes us put little value on our opinions and ideas. We constantly label ourselves as not being good enough. A healthy self-esteem empowers us to think positively about ourselves and our abilities.
<h2>5 way self-esteem is crucial in weight management programs</h2>
<h3>5. We see challenging situations as opportunities</h3>
Changes are difficult, especially if we are changing habits that have been with us for decades. A person with low self-esteem might look as challenges as impossible tasks to overcome, ultimately giving up. With a healthy self-esteem, we learn to face our current limitations and find ways to work towards changing for the better.
<h3>4. Confident in our abilities to control our lives</h3>
To make changes, we must set your intention, and believe in our ability to change. There are many people who set New Year resolutions but not many will follow through. If we do not believe in our abilities to make changes, we will remain in status quo despite our desire to make changes in your life. Feeling confident in accomplishing the steps that we design to change our lives is one leap forward in our weight management program.
<h3>3. Realistic in our expectations and less likely to be overcritical of ourselves</h3>
We let go of perfectionism. Perfectionism is a major source of stress. Aiming for perfectionism is setting ourselves up for disappointments and even failures. Let’s say we have a weight management program that requires us to lose 1kg in 2 weeks. If at the end of 2 weeks, we found out that we have gain weight instead, we might think that we have failed in your program. And if we failed for a lot of times, we might even think that this is an unattainable goal to pursue.

However, using weight as a measure is a one-dimensional aspect of weight loss. Depending on our body types, if we have built up muscles, the weight gain might be from the muscles. Our weight fluctuates during the various time of the day. Someone with a low self-esteem might become fixated on the results and think that they have failed. Having a healthy self-esteem empowers us to look for holistic answers and continue working towards our goals.

Most importantly, we need to have a clear understanding and accept that there will be good days and bad days and weight management seldom proceeds in a linear manner.
<h3>2. More resilient and better able to weather stress and setbacks</h3>
In life, there will be unpredictable events. So as we embark on a lifestyle change for weight management, there might be instances of relapse or an unhealthy meal. With a low self-esteem, we might frazzle over the past, and think that we have blown the whole weight management program. Having a healthy self-esteem, we will be able to use this experience as a reminder, forgive ourselves and make plans to tackle future temptations or setbacks. Instead of berating ourselves for the mistake, we can learn to empower yourself to make the right decision to go back to the healthy lifestyle.
<h3>1.Less likely to experience negative feelings such as worthlessness, guilt and shame</h3>
It is not uncommon for a person to come into a weight management program because they are motivated by guilt and shame. Mass media has altered our idea of beauty: we all have a tendency to feel that we need to have a certain body type to be beautiful. Guilt and shame might be very strong precursor feelings for embarking on a weight management program. However, throughout the program, such feelings will be detrimental. Negative emotions demotivates us. A permanent change in lifestyle requires a focus on positive emotions. This will motivate the person to enjoy a healthy lifestyle and make it easier to sustain it.

So how could we improve our self-esteem? In our next post, we will share with you our tips on maintaining a positive self esteem.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>7 ways to improve your self-esteem</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to be resilient in face of your obstacles? Want to reach your goals faster? Want to be happier?

Then you will have to check on your level of self-esteem.
<p class="quotes-border quotes-left one-third first"><strong>What is self-esteem?</strong>
Self-esteem is the overall opinion of ourselves – how we feel about our abilities and limitations. It is about having a healthy and balanced relationship with our selves. Self-esteem will be expressed through your habits, thoughts and actions.</p>

<h2>Why do we need self-esteem?</h2>
- Increase life satisfaction
- Improve our self-efficacy therefore we are more motivated to accomplish our goals and dreams
- Enable us to respond appropriately and adequately to challenges
- Improve our outlook of life and relationships with others
- Play a crucial role in healthy lifestyle/<a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-reasons-a-healthy-self-esteem-is-crucial-in-your-weight-management-program/" target="_blank">weight management</a>
- Become more self-aware and thus actively seeking way to develop ourselves

In other words, having a healthy self-esteem:
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Energizes. Empowers. Motivates.</h3>
We won’t be too afraid to shoot for the moon. We will not be too paralyzed to make plans.

After all, men look into the sky and invented airplane. Self-esteem is the cornerstone to the great achievements.

Here are<strong> 7 ways for you to improve your self-esteem in your daily life</strong>. They all take under 15 minutes for you to implement.
<h2>7. Positive self-talk</h2>
After becoming a freelancer, I realise I am my own best and worst critique. I am brutally honest to myself. There is a fine balance to achieve.

We don’t want to give ourselves excuses to slip into unacceptable behaviors. But we still want to forgive ourselves for mistakes and blunders. This can be done by applying realistic positive self-talk. Applying a positive self-talk technique means that it must be convincing to ourselves, have the emotional impact and realistic to us.

For example, there is no point telling ourselves that we are great at playing guitar when we only know 2 chords.

A more realistic self-talk will be, “<em>I am just a beginner in playing guitar right now. But if I were to practice for 1 hour every day, by the end of the third year, I will have put in over 1000 hours of practice. I will at least be a decent amateur player by then.</em>”
<h2>6. Don’t compare yourself to others</h2>
<p class="quotes-border quotes-right one-half">Even if they are your business competitiors or competitiors in any aspect, don’t fall into the trap of comparing. It will serve you better to study their techniques, business model and/or systems.</p>
People will always be better than you.

But you are also better than others.

It all depends on the aspects that you are comparing. Your seven-figures earning buddies might have more luxurious holidays but they might also endure more stress in a daily basis. Your hippie friends might seem to have more fun than you but they might also be more worried about their future.

Life is not fair. Sometimes, you have it more, sometimes you have it less. Life is about what sacrifices you are willing to make in order to achieve the gains you hope for. And sometimes you get more than you expected and sometimes less.

<strong>Stop berating yourself with the comparisons. Rather, learn from the success of others and apply it to your life.</strong>

Remember you are you, living out your own unique journey.
<h2>5. Focus on the things you can change</h2>
As we mention before, life is not fair. Some people are born rich. There are also some people who are born attached to their siblings.

There are many environmental factors that could not be changed easily. We can’t change the direction of the hurricane and we can’t change the economy. The more we attached ourselves to change such things, the more stressed we will be.

Instead, focus on the actions you can implement on the things that you can change, given your abilities and limitations.

<strong>You can’t change the situation but you can change your feelings and reactions to the situation.</strong>
<h2>4. Don’t beat yourself up when you make a mistake</h2>
What if you focus on things that you can change but you still did not manage to change it?

This brings us to the techniques to manage our mistakes or failures.
<p class="quotes-border quotes-right two-thirds" style="text-align: justify;">I haven’t failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work. --Thomas Edison</p>
I have not met anyone who has not failed in something in his/her life before. We are not great when we first started out.

I work in a few kitchens but I couldn’t cook a decent pot of rice when I am 20 years old. I lost count of the number of times I burn something on the stove. But I didn’t stop there. I continue to improve my cooking skills knowing that I will get better.

<strong>Mistakes are not here to mock us or stop us, they are here to teach us valuable lessons.</strong>
<h2>3. Celebrate the small stuffs</h2>
Self-esteem is about believing in your abilities.

<strong>You can build that belief by proving to yourself that you have the ability and self-efficacy.</strong>

Celebrate your small achievements, be it learning a new recipe, walking 1000 more steps, or making someone smile. Celebrate by treating yourself to a good meal, spending some time out in nature, allowing yourself more me-time or even just writing a thank you note to yourself. You can even give yourself a 5-minute self-appreciation break.

The point is to give yourself some attention and love, so that you feel good about doing. And this positive connection will motivates you to continue your desirable behaviors.
<h2>2. Write down 3 positive traits about yourself</h2>
Can’t seem to find anything to celebrate about? I’m pretty sure you are being humble about yourself.

<strong>We all have positive traits that are beneficial to ourselves, others, and the society.</strong>

Why not try this simple exercise?

Take 10 minutes, unplug from any form of electronic devices and sit in a location where you won’t have any distractions. Imagine you are your best friends or your colleagues. Are you humorous, kind or loyal? If you ask them to write down 3 traits that they admire, what will that be?
<h2>1. Remember the whys of high self-esteem</h2>
Sometimes, society hardens us so much that we feel thrashed at the end of the day.

First, we forsake our dreams, next we forget ourselves and then we forget why we are talking about self-esteem in the first place.

<strong>The best way to continue a behavior is to feel an emotional charge to it.</strong>

Remind yourself why you will like to have a positive self-esteem. Reread the introduction of this post if you have to.

Maybe you wish that having high self-esteem will help to perform better at work by removing self-doubt. Maybe you hope that having a healthy self-esteem will give you the confidence to talk to your dream date.

Write it down and feel it, understand why having a high self-esteem is important to you and believe in the possibility. Even better, put it at places that you can see regularly.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Be successful: SMART goal for weight loss</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/be-successful-smart-goals-for-weight-loss/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[January is almost over, how are your new year ‘s resolutions coming to? Is one of your resolution to lose weight? How are things progressing for you?

Previously, we talk about how <a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-things-to-ignite-your-2015/">new year’s resolutions don’t work</a>. I still think it doesn’t.
<p class="quotes-border quotes-right one-half">Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world. -- Joel A. Barker</p>
Goals that inspire you to draft a plan will have a higher chance of working. Since it is almost coming to February, it’s time to shift the gear from a resolution mindset to a goal mindset. Knowing how to set effective goals will help you to achieve more in different aspects of your life. Today, we will focus on applying the SMART goal setting technique in managing our weight.
<h2>Specific</h2>
Vague goals will get you nowhere. It has no power, no motivation and no energy. In other words, they are not effective. Many times, when people want to lose weight, they go about saying that they want to “tone some muscles” or “lose some weight”.

Get specific with the goals that you want to accomplish. Find your intrinsic motivation. Do you have a specific measurement you are looking at? Do you want to have more energy to play with your kids? Are you looking to improve your health so that you could take that sailing trip that you’ve been dreaming of?
<h2>Measurable</h2>
You will need to track your progress so that you can see if you are moving forward with the program. Rather than focusing on the number of the scale, I want you to shift it to improving your capability and fitness level.

Is it being able to run a 5km run within a desirable timing? How many healthy meals do you wish to include in your weeks? Find ways to track your healthy habits in tangible ways.

When you monitor your progress in a tangible way, you will feel more motivated and inspired towards achieving your ultimate goal.
<h2>Attainable</h2>
Big dreams will inspire but it will soon paralyse you if you do not know how to manage them. Attempting to accomplish a big goal without a systematic approach will soon overwhelm you and lead to disappointment.

In comparison, small changes are easier to make.

Break down your vision into monthly goals. From your monthly goals, determine your mini weekly goals.

Although I call the small changes here, these weekly goals should still possess a bit of challenge to you so that as to keep yourself motivated and reinforce your self-efficacy.
<h2>Relevant</h2>
Goals should be relevant to your life, interest, needs and abilities. Say for example, you want to run a full marathon, will your current health condition allows you to complete that? Having a goal that you can relate to in your life will motivate you more than a goal which is irrelevant.
<h2>Time-bound</h2>
Set a timeline for your goal. This way, you can evaluate your progress regularly to see if you are moving towards your goal. You can evaluate your goals, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and so forth.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>10 ways to avoid consuming unnecessary calories during Chinese New Year</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/10-ways-to-avoid-consuming-unnecessary-calories-during-chinese-new-year/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We all have fond memories of Chinese New Year (CNY). Red packets, great company, long weekends, sleep-ins.

And food.

There is really nothing like food that binds people together. Being chinese, I have my fair share of relatives who think that chubby kids are cute and healthy. Even nowadays, I will sometimes still be stuffed in the face with food by my relatives and friends.

As we usher in the year of monkey, will we also be strapping on unnecessary calories around our body?

If you are on a weight management program since January, CNY might just undone your efforts and overload your calories intake if you are not vigilant.

So, here are 10 ways for you to avoid consuming unnecessary calories during CNY while still having a great time.
<h2>10. Know your numbers</h2>
Knowledge is power. Two pieces of pineapple tart is 164 calories. A piece of bak kwa contains 229 calories. If you want to burn off a piece of bak kwa, you will have to run 3.7km in 23 minutes. Let’s be real, who ever really just eat one bak kwa? The numbers add up quickly if you are not aware of it.
<h2>9. Figure out the healthy food beforehand</h2>
There is definitely going to be lots of eating. Reunion dinner, house visit, and friends gathering. During this period of time, it is almost impossible to avoid eating without coming across as rude. But you can choose to eat healthily. Identify the healthy goodies, like oranges, sunflower seeds and pistachio nuts. Make a mental note and stick to eating them to avoid the uphill battle of willpower.
<h2>8. Keep some nuts with you</h2>
Chances are slim that there won’t be anything healthy. However, just in case, bring a handful of nuts with you. They will help you to maintain satiety and avoid over eating.
<h2>7. Eat a salad, protein with vinaigrette before visiting</h2>
If you have the time, fill up your body with some salad, a fistful of protein with vinaigrette before you leave your house. This will help you to eat less during your rounds of visiting. Vegetables are full of nutrients. Protein will help to increase fullness and reduce hunger throughout the day. Apple cider vinegar appears to control blood sugar.
<h2>6. Set a quota</h2>
I know I’m starting to sound like a party pooper by making everything sounds so systematic. But having a system will enable you to enjoy the unhealthy food without guilt. If you decide to eat the unhealthy food, just make a plan of how many pieces of bak kwa you are going to eat. Try putting your food in a small bowl to control the quantity. Tell yourself that, once the food in the bowl is done, it’s done.
<h2>5. Eat mindfully</h2>
<a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-effective-ways-to-start-eating-mindfully/" target="_blank">Eating mindfully</a> enables you to savor the flavor of the food and become more in tune with your body satiety.
<h2>4. Limit your sugary drink</h2>
The best choice is to take plain water. Prolong and excessive intake of simple sugar is bad for the teeth, blood sugar and health. Sugar is addictive and sugary drinks make you fat. 1 can of coke has 33g of sugar. According to Health Promotion Board, we should not be taking in more than 40g-55g of sugar per day. Best to stay away from the sugary drinks and can drinks and opt for traditional tea or plain water instead.
<h2>3. Don’t watch TV while snacking</h2>
When I was a kid, my mum always tells me not to watch the TV when I am eating. It turns out that my mum is right. When you eat while watching TV, you will be distracted. Distracted eating will cause you to eat more.
<h2>2. Get active</h2>
Are there young kids you can play with? Take this opportunity to bond with them and get active. By moving around and playing, you will be able to move your attention away from the bottomless pit of calories on the table.
<h2>1. Indulge in the company, not the comfort food.</h2>
Food is not a prerequisite to having a great time. Create meaningful conversations and memories with your friends and relatives. Chinese New Year is about reunion, so why not make this year’s celebration in line with the true spirit of CNY?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Food gets me very excited. I love food. That’s why I immerse myself in the health food industry for 3 years. During this period of time, I am exposed to exotic food like quinoa from the Andean region, chia seed from the Aztecs, spirulina from the sea and so much more.

Truth be told, I did not always eat healthy food. When I was younger, I’m a fan of fast food, meat, fatty food and fried foods. Nowadays, I don’t exactly abstain from eating unhealthy food but I find more joy in savoring my healthy meals. Not to mention, losing inches off my tummy.

Anyone can make these changes. Anyone can choose to live a healthy lifestyle. It might not be easy in the beginning but once you start to reap the benefits of healthy food, you will never look back. Just like me. Here are 7 tips for you to kick start healthier eating for a slimmer waistline<strong>.</strong>
<h2>7. Minimise your intake of processed food</h2>
<p class="quotes-border quotes-right one-third">Dangerous ingredients found in processed food:
Butylated hydroxytoluene
High fructose corn syrup
Partially hydrogenated oil
Sodium nitrate</p>
Ice cream, microwaved meals, canned food with 3 years shelf life, potato chips, biscuits and all other processed food have make eating more convenient. However, they also bring with them a list of problems. They are loaded with chemicals, lacked nutrients and contained additives and preservatives. Also, processed foods are linked to the rise of obesity.¹

Whenever possible, opt for food in their most natural form: fresh produce.
<h2>6. Eat mindfully</h2>
<a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-effective-ways-to-start-eating-mindfully/">Learn to eat mindfully.</a> You will enjoy your food more. Notice the nuances and textures of the food by taking smaller bites and chewing more. By becoming mindful and present, you can tune in better to your body satiety and hunger. Yes, there is such a thing as too much healthy food.
<h2>5. Eat regular meals</h2>
Regular eating prevents binge eating, keeps your blood sugar steady and maintains your metabolism rate.

When you skip a meal, you might be experiencing extreme hunger when you finally get to eat. With extreme hunger, there’s a higher chance of you eating too quickly and binge eating. The constant lack of food might send a signal to your body that you are experiencing a “famine”. Your body will attempt to conserve energy, lower the metabolism rate and go into storage mode. This means that your food will be stored as fat more easily.
<h2>4. Eat based on My Healthy Plate</h2>
<p class="quotes-border quotes-left one-third" style="text-align: center;">Plant-based proteins:
Lentils
Hemp seeds
Chia seeds
Quinoa
Tofu
Nuts</p>
Health Promotion Board recommends <a href="http://www.hpb.gov.sg/HOPPortal/health-article/HPB064355" target="_blank">splitting your plate into ½ plate of vegetables, ¼ plate of protein and ¼ plate of carbohydrates</a>. Eating carbohydrate and protein will help you to maintain your blood sugar level and prevent the extreme fluctuation of blood sugar levels. Protein also improves satiety level.

Don’t be afraid of dietary fats, they are needed to make a meal satisfying and delicious. Your body needs fats to function and provide you with energy. Just be careful not to over consume them.
<h2>3. Stock up on healthy food</h2>
The best way to avoid processed food is to remove them from your life. Get to the produce aisle of the supermarket and stock up on your healthy food: beans, grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables and healthier choices of sauces.

If you are looking for something more fun, choose kale chips or black beans chip over potato chips. If you need some processed food during the transition, choose those that have no trans fat.
<h2>2. Take note of the level of energy after eating</h2>
Speaking from personal experience, I think that the best way to transition to a healthy lifestyle is by keeping tab on the energy level after each meal.

Adopting a vegetarian diet, I am able to focus better, feel more energized and not fall sick easily. When I notice all these positive effects, it inspires me to continue. And the more I continue on my healthy lifestyle, the more I notice the positive effects, setting me into a positive cycle of success.
<h2>1. Drink water instead of sugary drinks</h2>
Sugary drinks are empty calories. They contain calories without filling you up and giving you nutrients. You consume 240 calories from a bottle of soda. To burn that amount of calories, you will need to run 3km in 15 minutes or walk 4.2km in 45 minutes. Not to mention, all the sugar contains inside a soda are turned into fat, may cause diabetes² and increase the risk of cancer³.

If plain water is too bland for you, try adding lemon juice. Or if you have to have sweet drinks, dilute them and slowly decrease the intake of sugary drinks until you could take in plain water.

		<title>4 ways to increase your commitment to weight management program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the first thing that you think about when people mention weight loss?

Many people will conjure up images of deprivation. Not being able to eat the food they like. Endless exercises. Running like a gazelle. Giving up the comfort of their cosy chair. Moving around a place full of self-obsessed people.

It is precisely this line of thought that prevents people from starting a weight management program.

I did not start out loving the gym. If you were to tell me 5 years ago that I will love hanging out in the gym, I will think that you are crazy. I’m not selling you a castle in the cloud, I’m talking about sustainable changes that will stage you up for success in your weight management program.

Today, I’m going to tell you how you could increase your commitment to weight management plan and avoid the pitfall of self-sabotaging behaviors like “I’m not good enough”, "It's too scary" or “I’m never getting there”.
<h2>4. Start easy</h2>
Do you apply for CEO when you just graduate from school? Changes are you start as an executive on the lower management level. So why is it that when people approach weight loss, they change their diet and exercise from one extreme to the other extreme? After a few days, they start to have cravings and they have to struggle with their willpower. Yes, some people have super willpower to succeed this way. But for one person that succeed, there are many more who will scrap their diet change as a failure and think that there is no point in doing it.

<strong>It's much easier to start with small changes and work towards your ultimate goal.</strong>

If you are just starting out, even eating one healthy meal or exercising once a week is a great start. Once it becomes habitual, you can start increasing the amount of healthy food, cutting the calories and exercising more regularly.
<h2>3. Have a structured plan</h2>
I’m not always a fan of having a structured plan. But over the years, I feel that having a structured plan will reduce my needs to rely on my emotions to make decision. Of course, it is great that if you are feeling motivated and are hitting the gym, exercising regularly and eating clean. But what happen if you are not feeling your very best and decide to skip the gym for one day, and then the next, and then the next?

<strong>Having a structured plan reduces the guesswork and need to rely on willpower.</strong>

Make it as specify as possible. If Thursday is your legs day, on Wednesday night, plan out the time you are going to the gym, exact exercises, reps, sets. I will go so far as to even plan the rest time in between sets.
<h2>2. Let go of perfectionism</h2>
<strong>It is normal for hiccups to happen. A structured plan is important but flexibility is also key.</strong> If this sounds paradoxical, let me explain further.

There will be unforeseen circumstances. Let’s say your family got into an accident, you won’t be sticking to your gym plan. And there is also something called the holidays. Rather than giving up on your exercise plan because you have been missing out on four days or even weeks, continue from where you stop and keep on going.

When you are embarking on a weight management program, you ought to be giving yourself a huge applaud for taking a conscious step to make changes. The last thing you want to do is to beat yourself out with notions that you are undisciplined and destined to fail. Let go of all of this and take every new opportunity to work towards your goal.
<h2>1. Identify the importance of weight loss in your life</h2>
One of the effective ways to encourage people to stay on a weight management program is for them to identify the importance of the weight loss in their lives.

If you have been living an unhealthy lifestyle for 20-40 years, you need to find motivation: reasons for you to exercise and eat clean.

<strong>Motivation comes in different forms: extrinsic, intrinsic and a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic.</strong>

Extrinsic motivation is external factor that motivates you. It can be advice from doctors and suggestion from the spouse. This form of motivation may encourage you initially but they seldom provide long term motivation. You want to also explore the intrinsic motivation of your weight loss, which is your own personal achievement that you can derive from the behavioral change. It can be things like less stress. Lastly, these motivations do not have to be mutually exclusive. You can combine them to motivate yourself.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>6 ways weight training make you a better dancer</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You are a dancer. You live and breathe dance. One of the things that you should care is improving your dance techniques.

How are you planning to achieve that? Will it be endless hours of drills?

As a belly dancer, I use to spend 2 hours each day on dancing, hoping that I will be a better dancer. My techniques did improve a bit but it is agony. Looking back, it is ineffective and slow. If I can turn back the clock, I will tell my 24-year-old self that I will need to go to the gym and lift heavy.

Lift heavy? Isn’t that going to make a dancer looks bulky? When we talk about adding muscle mass, hypertrophy, it takes a very specific program to achieve that. Besides training, you need to be eating a lot of food to be gaining mass. And it also depends a lot on your genetic potential to grow.
<h2>Weight training for dancer</h2>
Yes, you might grow some muscles but rest assured you will not turn into a she-hulk overnight. Having said that, here are 6 ways weight training can make you a better dancer. You can decide for yourself if it will be worth it to hit the gym for your dance form.
<h2>6. Better body coordination</h2>
Lifting weight helps you to have better neural adaptation. A neural adaptation is the improvement of the ability of the nervous system to activate the muscles. To put it simply, dance is all about contraction of muscles. And so is weight training.

For example, in belly dance, when you are doing a hips lift, you are contracting your oblique and glutes muscles. A chest lift requires contraction of the trapezius and rhomboids muscles.

In weight training, you have to focus on contracting various muscles. Over time, this will improve your neural adaptation. Better ability of contraction of muscles mean better execution of techniques.
<h2>5. More strength in limbs</h2>
Have you seen dancers who just can’t seem to control their arms and legs? It looks like they are indecisive and imprecise. The notion of any dancers without strength is an illusion. Grace comes with strength. When a dancer needs to execute slow movements, they have to be precise. And to do that, they will have to have strength. Even for a dance as graceful as ballet, the dancers require a lot of lower body strength and explosive power to execute movements like arabesque and ballet leaps.

Notice how tone the dancers are.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpVf5-aTgys" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2>4. More core stability</h2>
When we talk about core, we are referring to your torso, not just your abs. Your core is where all the power is generated.

Have you seen dancers who hunch unconsciously? They look like they are afraid to be on the stage and can’t wait to get off the stage.  You need core stability to stand upright.

You also need core stability to do isolation movement. Dances like popping and belly dance involves a lot of body isolation. This isolation effect comes from your ability to hold your core still.
<h2>3. Better body outline</h2>
Rather than becoming bulky, if you train specifically for strength and dance form, you will achieve a more muscular body. If you look at gymnasts, they are strong, flexible yet light. Not everyone who trains will become the next body builder. Remember how we mention at the start that it takes a lot of effort to actually bulk up?

This might be a personal preference but I think looking at dancers with toned body looks way better and healthier than stick thin dancers. Once again, you can refer to the video above if you have not watched it.
<h2>2. Reduce injuries</h2>
You will most probably think that going to the gym will cause more injuries. We all hear stories about guys who tear a muscle or worse, get crushed under the barbell. I injure my left shoulder once.

Weight lifting is a sport after all. And all sport comes with a certain amount of risk. However, most injuries from weight lifting can be summed down to poor form, lifting weights that are too heavy and unbalance training methods.

Flexibility does prevent injury but only up to a certain point. Being too flexible on the under hand will cause injuries. And most dancers have too much flexibility to start with. The strength of the muscles, ligaments and tendons will hold your joints in place, provide more support and protect your joints from impact.
<h2>1. Increase muscular endurance</h2>
The last thing you want is to look tired in the midst of your performance. If your dance form requires you to perform many sets or for an extended period, you definitely need to train for your cardiovascular and muscular endurance.

Upper body muscular endurance is something that most aerobics and cardio exercise don’t improve. However if you train with weights, you can tweak your training to suit the kind of muscular endurance required by your dance form.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Food! If you have not heard, I love food. I work in F&amp;B outlet before and can talk about food all day long.

Food is an important part of our lives. We need it in socialising, cultural exchange, family gathering and parties. Nowadays, we are constantly surrounded with the physical presence or marketing effort of food. No wonder, obesity is on the rise. We are being bombarded constantly to think about food.

We need to eat. And we are what we eat. It is not just about satisfying our taste buds. We need nutritious food to feed our body and soul.

In a supermarket, there are a plethora of rich and sinful food to tempt us. There are new type of food coming out every so often, vying for our attention and money. Sometimes it looks too delicious and too valuable to miss out. Sometimes it is hard to stay healthy.

I’ve been there. I love my chips. But I also know what they will do to my body. With that knowledge, I try to make the best decision for my health in the long run. Anyone can achieve that. Here are 5 tips to get you started on avoiding temptation in the supermarket.
<h2>5. Create a grocery list</h2>
Plan out the perishable food that you need for the week. Add in other dried food items that you will need to stock up. Focus on the items you need and get out of the supermarket. If you don’t see it, you reduce your chance of having to fight with temptation.

Having a well-planned grocery list will help you to reduce food spoilage, missed out food items. It could also help you to save on dried goods if you plan your bulk non-perishable purchases to coincide with discount and sales.
<h2>4. Avoid the middle aisle</h2>
Generally, a supermarket is designed to have their fresh produce on the external aisle and junk food on the inner aisle. Similar to the previous rule, if you could help yourself by not looking at the junk food, you reduce your chance of having to fight with temptation.

Make your time fun in the produce aisle. Explore the colors and shapes of the fresh produces. Buy something that you have never cooked before. Learn about a new fresh produce. Heard of artichoke? How about fennel or brussels sprout?
<h2>3. Go on a full stomach</h2>
Food deprivation can alter the way we react to food. If we are hungry, we have a tendency to choose food that is higher in calories¹. This will happen if we are deprived of food even for a short period of time. The smart thing to do is to munch on some nuts or have your meal before heading down to the grocer.
<h2>2. Plan in temptations</h2>
Yes, this article is about avoiding temptation. But having cheat meals is not an uncommon practice. We can’t always be perfect in our eating habits.The real world requires us to build in some flexibility.

A dieter might develop an all-or-nothing mindset. If they eat something unhealthy, they might have a higher tendency to overindulge as compared to non-restrained eaters.

Rather than constantly depriving yourself and fall into an all-or-nothing mindset, you want to develop a healthy relationship with food. Plan for your temptations. Allow yourself to have X number of junk food in this trip. Don't fight with your willpower, set strategies in place to ease into healthy eating.
<h2>1. Avoid food with more than 5 ingredients that you cannot pronounced</h2>
Although I mention that you could plan in for temptation, it doesn’t mean that everything should be free for all. Nowadays, some of our food products should be categorised more as a chemist toy than as a food. We have potassium benzonate, sodium benzonate, propyl gallate, butylated hydrozyttoluene and so on. And what does artificial flavouring really mean?

Best to stick with your fresh produce. However, if you need to purchase convenient food, always be food savvy and stay away from long list of chemical-laden ingredients.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever felt that you are not good enough for your role? I have.

I am a fitness instructor and I used to feel like I am a fraud. I am 1.63m with a weight of 54kg. I have a BMI of around 20 and that should be considered healthy.

But the truth is I’m skinny fat.

I am slim but I have muffin tops. Basically, I am flabby. And truth be told, when it comes to skinny for Asian, I am no where near that. I look into the mirror and I feel unconvincing. I did not suffer from body image issues but I believe I could be better. At the same time, my fitness career is going nowhere. Classes come and go. My financial and work life is a wreck.

Luckily, the practice of yoga teaches me how to love and appreciate myself for who I am and for where I am at. I know I have to look forward and ignite the change necessary for me to become who I want to be.
<h2>And weight lifting comes into my life.</h2>
Weight lifting knocks on my heart almost like how yoga comes into my life as an epiphany. I have faith in the calling of my heart. So far, it hasn’t failed me. It has always shown me the direction that I need to be.

Initially, I got my friend to show me the ropes. Soon after, I find myself reading articles and books on weightlifting until I am confident enough to step into the gym alone. Today, I step in the gym with my own exercise plan. I lift the weights with a vision.

Throughout my journey, I build up muscles and tone my body. And most importantly, I see the way I handle my business transform as well.

I use to be passive, waiting for people to contact me for business. I used to share my services like I am not fully confident of it. Now, I’m actively networking and creating meaningful relationship. I am seeking out mentorship and surrounding myself with successful and wise people. I speak of my business with faith and conviction. Most importantly, I know my services are of high value and it could transform people.
<h2>Because I have been through the transformation myself.</h2>
It is the exhilaration that I feel when I lift 40kg off the floor. It’s the feeling that I got when I lift more than I did previously. It’s the focus that I need to lift in proper form. It’s the correction of my posture that gives me confidence.

Today, I stand in front of students, friends and strangers, knowing fully that I am good enough. Knowing that I understand different muscles groups and how they function. Knowing that I could guide a class safely and effectively. Knowing that my services work.
<h2>Weight lifting saves my life.</h2>
Weight lifting also reminds me that I could push pass my own mental limits and create records for myself. It shows me that progress comes with careful planning. At the same time, it shows me that I have to drop my ego in front of the weights, if not I will risk injuring myself.

In yoga, I am taught that our physical world is intricately linked to our internal world. How we do one thing is how we do everything. Through the internal workings, weight lifting brings upon to me a new world and possibilities.
<h2>It breaks the old me down.</h2>
A new me is created and strengthened.

In my life, I appreciate coming into contact with yoga and weightlifting. It challenges my perspective and allows me to learn more about life and myself.

<strong>Today, I am at peace. Today, I am who I need to be.  </strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>11 ways weight lifting will change your life</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/how-weight-lifting-saves-my-life/" target="_blank">Weight lifting saves my life</a>. It is not merely about what happen in the gym. It is also about the transformation that occurs in my life. Besides looking better, I gain confidence, become more focus and achieve more in my life.

Weight lifting has that power. Here are <strong>11 ways</strong> that weight lifting changes your life.
<h2>11. You’ll look great</h2>
Lifting weights help you to get lean and toned. You get the healthy shape you are looking for. Cardio might slim you down but you will never achieve that athletic look without implementing resistance training in your life. Ladies, do not worry about getting bulky, it takes a specific hypertrophy program and nutritional plan to gain mass.
<h2>10. Get stronger mentally</h2>
As you get stronger physically, you will get stronger mentally. Often times, weight lifting requires you to persevere and push yourself to overcome the mental barriers and physical discomfort. It is about moving out of your comfort zone into your uncomfortable zone. If you repeat this simple act for enough time, you will expand your comfort zone. And that is how success happens.
<h2>9. Prevent osteoporosis</h2>
Osteoporosis is a thinning of bone when the formation of new bone is slower than the depletion of bone. Therefore, the bones become brittle and are more prone to fracture. Weight lifting over a period of time can prevent bone loss and even increase bone density.
<h2>8. Improve balance</h2>
Our core is the key to maintaining our balance. You need to activate your core during weight lifting, especially single leg exercises or asymmetrical exercises, to maintain your balance and posture. Through weight lifting, you get stronger in your core muscles and improve your balance.
<h2>7. Lose fats</h2>
Weight lifting maintains/builds muscles, increases resting metabolic rate and improves insulin resistance, which are important factors in fat loss. When you only use cardio to manage your weight, you tend to lose fats and muscles, which will decrease your metabolism rate. However, if you add resistance training, and maintain or build muscles, you turn your body to a calories furnace.
<h2>6. Better posture</h2>
Due to our sedentary lifestyle, we might be facing muscular imbalances, such as weak back and tight hip flexors. Poor posture could possibly cause negative effects, such as back pain and lower confidence. With weight training, you could strengthen the weaker muscles and improve your posture.
<h2>5. Boost self-esteem</h2>
If you just begin to lift weights, you will notice that you are often setting personal record: lifting heavier weights, improving coordination and lifting more reps. This constant feedback of improvement will make you feel good about yourself and help to improve your self-esteem.
<h2>4. Increase focus</h2>
When you lift weights, you will have to focus on your breathing, posture and muscular contraction. Lifting weight with focus on the correct form will translate into increase in concentration on other aspects of your life.
<h2>3. Become happy</h2>
If there is a happy pill, exercise is it! Yes, physical exercise lifts your mood and makes you happy. Weight lifting will work wonder for your mental health.
<h2>2. Perform better in other sports</h2>
Weight lifting improves muscular strength, endurance and coordination. It also helps to prevent sports injuries. If you are already involve in other kind of sports, lifting weights will help you to perform better.
<h2>1. Inspire others</h2>
People will notice your changes, be it your body, energy level, productivity or confidence level. They will ask you about your secret. This is your chance to make a difference to others by sharing the benefits of weight lifting.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Which is more precious? Time or health?</h2>
Often, I hear people they do not have time to manage their health.

The irony is,  in the long run, the lack of health maintenance will cost them more time.

<strong>Why do we have to choose between the two? Why do the both of them have to be mutually exclusive?</strong>

I use to believe that if I miss one day of training, I will deteriorate. I use to practice yoga for 1 hour and dance for 1 hour. That’s not counting the time I have to travel to dance classes and watch dance videos. On top of that, I have to prepare my breakfast and lunch.

If chronic obsession with dance is a thing, I have it.

No wonder other aspects of my life are not going anywhere for me. Now, I exercise an hour a day, 3-5 days a week, and I feel much fitter, stronger and healthier. Some days, when things get hectic, I do 10 minutes body weight workout.
<h2>I am in better balance.</h2>
I am managing my time optimally. I know how to train smarter. I understand my priorities.

In fact, I realize exercise comes after non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) in the aspects of health.  NEAT is the calories expended outside of eating, exercising and sleeping. Basically becoming less sedentary, i.e. sitting less, should be looked into before contemplating about hitting the gym for an hour.

Don’t be another me.
<h2>Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that more always equals to better.</h2>
Steady state cardio workouts that last for more than 45 minutes have their own unique benefits. You can continue this form of exercise if you enjoy it. However, if you are someone like me, looking to slot in short bursts of workout in a time crammed lifestyle, here is a <strong>workout program that is just going to take you 10 minutes.</strong>

&nbsp;
<h2>10 minutes body weight workout</h2>
Get your interval timer ready. The magic of short workout is in the burst of energy. It will only work if you push yourself to more than 70% of your effort.

<em>If you are new to circuit training, you want to work in 30s and rest for 30s. (Or feel free to go into any intervals that are more suitable for you.)
If you are familiar with circuit training, we are not going to take any rest. You are going to run through these 10 exercises in 1 minute interval each.</em>

<strong>Burpees
</strong>From standing position, squat down and place both of your palms firmly on the floor. From this position either hop or walk back into a plank position. From the plank position, again, either hop or walk back into a squatting position. Explode into a jump or just stand and rise onto the balls of your feet.

<strong>Squats
</strong>Make sure your feet are firmly grounded and aligned with your knee. Tighten your glutes muscles (butt). Hinge from your hips. Lead your squat with your glutes. Imagine that you are sitting down on a chair behind you. If you are fit, add an explosive hop when coming out from your squat position.

<strong>High knees
</strong>Have your hands in front of you at hips level. Lift your knees such that your knees touch your palms. Make sure you are not rounding your back in this exercise. Go as fast as you can.

<strong>Rear lunges
</strong>Take your right foot back and go into a lunge position. Step back into lunge position. Alternate the feet that step back each time. If you feel that you could do more, switch legs with a hop.

<strong>Side plank with left arm on floor
</strong>Engage your core and hold yourself up in a side plank position. If you feel strong, straighten your right arm, such that your arms and body form a t shape.

<strong>Inchworm
</strong>From a standing position, bend forward such that your palms are down on the floor. Walk your hands out to a pushup position while keeping your legs straight. Walk your hands back towards your legs and straighten your body.

<strong>Side plank with right arm on floor</strong>
This is to balance out the previous side plank.

<strong>Glute bridge</strong>
Lie supine with knees bend. Contract your glutes and lift into a bridge position, making sure not to compress your lower back. Lower yourself down without allowing your glutes to touch the floor. And lift.

<strong>Lateral crawl</strong>
Start in a pushup position with your core tight. Cross your right arm over your left arm and move towards the left, coordinating the leg movements with the hands movement. Move 5 times to the left. And repeat on the right side.

<strong>Elbow plank</strong>
Have your elbows on the floor. Tighten all your muscles and go into a plank pose.

And you just finish a 10 minutes workout. If you still feel like going, repeat this round.

		<title>Dance conditioning: 4 muscles groups that all dancers should work on</title>
		<link>http://www.thegeekwing.com/dance-conditioning-4-muscles-group/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you devote a lot of time to perfecting your dance? Do you include dance conditioning in your routine?

Regardless of your dance form, be it ballet, belly dance, hip hop or hula dance, you requires grace, artistry and strength. In our usual dance classes, most of us are tasked to work on our techniques, muscular endurance and choreography.

<strong>Strength is often a forgotten part of the equation.</strong>

Yet, strength is the base which gives us the poise and mastery. In order to increase muscular strength, we have to slightly overload our muscles, either with our body weight or external resistance, like <a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/6-ways-weight-training-make-you-a-better-dancer/">weights</a> or resistance bands.

The gym is like a playground to some. But for most people, it is a maze.

In order to facilitate your strengthening journey for your dance career, I have listed some major muscles groups that you can start to work on to improve your dance.
<h2>Upper back: Rhomboids muscles</h2>
Starting from the top, you want to be familiar with the rhomboids muscles. Rhomboids muscles are rhomboid-shaped muscles that are attached to your shoulder blade and spine. Weak rhomboids muscles coupled with other muscular imbalance are usually the cause of the rounded upper back and forward head syndrome.

A rounded posture on stage usually conveys a lack of confidence and it also disrupts the energetic line of a dancer. Working on the rhomboids will aid in improving your posture and convey more confidence.

<strong>Exercises:</strong> <em>Shoulder blade squeeze. Incline pull up. All forms of rows that emphasize on squeezing of the shoulder blades.</em>
<h2>Core: Abdominals muscles (abs) and oblique muscles</h2>
Abs and oblique are probably two of the most common muscles that people know. Weak abs give us a pot belly look. A weak core (basically the whole of your torso) might result in an inability to stabilize when dancing.

If you are not stable when you are spinning or making sudden directional change, you have weak core muscles and hence, lack the ability to brace your core effectively. This will in turn leads to poor isolation or movement techniques.

<strong>Exercise:</strong> <em>Plank. Variations of plank. Squats. Deadlifts. Any form of exercises that require us to brace and stabilize our core.</em>
<h2>Core: Gluteal muscles</h2>
Gluteal muscles are a group of muscles that makes up your buttocks and core. Weak gluteal muscles can cause a saggy looking butt and a flat lower back. As mention above, a weak core might result in an ability to stabilize. Depending on your dance form, your dance, think belly dance and samba, might require you to move your butt constantly. You will definitely need strength and muscular endurance to be able to achieve that.

If you cannot execute your hips movements quickly, you have weak gluteal muscles. Working on the gluteal muscles will enable you to make stronger and faster movements.

<strong>Exercises:</strong> <em>Walking on the incline, uphill. Donkey kicks. Bridge. Squats. Lunges.</em>
<h2>Legs: Thighs</h2>
The legs are the most used part of a dancer repertoire. From moving, to leaping, to spinning to falling, all these require the legs to do the work. The thighs, both the front, the quadriceps, and the back, the hamstring, play important roles in executing all these movements.

If you have trouble coming up from a squatting position, you have weak quadriceps and glutes. However, in dancers, an overactive quadriceps, might cause lengthened hamstring. An overactive quadriceps and over flexible hamstring will cause muscular imbalance. And as we have seen above, muscular imbalance or weak muscles is not optimal for our body functioning. Thus, dancers have to work more on strengthening their hamstring as well.

<strong>Exercise:</strong> <em>Sprint. Squat. Split squat. Hamstring curl.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are going to share with you the way to happiness.
<h2>The key is to have dance in your life.</h2>
Is it a wonder that Zumba got so popular? Previously we have spoken about the <a href="http://www.mysantosh.com/5-benefits-of-belly-dancing/" target="_blank">benefits of belly dancing</a>. Today we are going to look into how dance is going to improve our mood and reduce our stress.

Are you about to skip this article and say that you can’t dance?

That’s not true.
<h2>Dance your way to happiness.</h2>
You don’t have to be a professional dancer to know how to dance. Dance is something that occurs naturally in us. We are meant to move.

Have you ever notice how a baby bounce to the beats of the music naturally? In fact, researchers have found that babies respond to the rhythm and the tempo and the music and find it more engaging than speech.

We’ve all been through the dreaded and monotonous lecturers that make us wish that we are somewhere else. And hopefully, you have been lucky enough to be captivated by entertaining presenters as well. As a presenter myself, I find variations, tonality and body language play a huge role in engaging people. I could be presenting an exciting news, but if I am to use a flat voice, chances are even I, myself am dreading the session.

In this sense, presentation is a lot like dance. You make use of the highs and lows, pauses and movements to captivate and engage your audience. In fact, you can find many parallelism of dance in life. Courtship, negotiation, sales and relationship management.
<h2>That's why you can have dance in anything you do.</h2>
Music is exciting to us. Change and movement can invigorate us.

Dance improves our emotional level. As dancing is a form of exercise, it will release endorphin, which reduces pain. High energy dance with others will increase our positive feelings. Besides that, dancing enhances social bonding, increases confidence and self-esteem, in additional to the usual benefits that exercises bring to us.

Personally, I connect with my feminine side when I start to learn belly dancing. Previously, I was rash and stubborn. This personality has caused me many costly mistakes. Nowadays, I’m more balanced and make more holistic and informed decisions.

Just like in dance, I know when to advance and when to retreat.

The most powerful thing in dance might not be movement. Instead it could be the pauses that the dancers inject to emphasize and heighten the viewing experience. It takes confidence for a dancer to hold the stage in stillness. It takes wisdom to know when to be in a void.
<h2>All these fundamentals of dance could easily translate into life.</h2>
Dance is powerful because we are in the moment. And it is not the act of seeking for happiness that makes us happy.

Happiness is about being in the moment and becoming present. Dance will not allow you to have wandering thoughts even for a beat. Because if you do just that, you will miss a beat and maybe, even the next few beats.

Whether you are an amateur or a professional, dance and music do not discriminate. Only minds do. But our minds could not wander when we are immersing ourselves fully in dance. Hopefully, when you dance, you indulge in every moment of it.

Ultimately, this is the key to why dance is such a powerful way to happiness.

If you could write a letter to yourself when you are younger, say in your early 20s, what will you say to yourself?

Many people will encourage you to enjoy the present or to work towards the future. However, looking back at how far you have traveled, will sometimes fuel you with the drive as well.

Once, I've written <a href="http://www.thegeekwing.com/a-motivational-read-for-25-year-old/">a letter for myself when I'm 25.</a>

Now, this is a letter for me in my early 20s.
<h2>To Wing in her early 20s,</h2>
Many times, you will feel frustrated with the lack of progress in your life. But there will too be times when you are driven with the notion of invincibility, achieving what most couldn’t have. Yes, you are different. Yes, you never try to shun from that.

Throughout your early 20s, you will have to bear the judgement of others. But I assure you that you will survive to be stronger. And you will definitely live life in your own terms.

Now, I’m in your late 20s, that’s about 2500+ days older than you are now.
<h3>Your early twenties will be an incredible journey.</h3>
Yes, you will be living your dream. And there will be a lifetime of stories waiting for you to experience.

Late 20s for you, as I am now, will hold stability, maybe much to your surprise.

Remember the year when you say that if you didn’t achieve what you set to achieve by 25, you will go to the path which many are? Well, you didn’t really reach where you foresee yourself, but neither did you embark on the conventional. But it is okay.
<h3>Looking back, I admire you for your passion, grit and determination.</h3>
There are many things that you shouldn’t do. But you will do it anyway. To be honest, life is still a mystery to me. What they feed you on, the linear route has never aligned its path to you.

There are many things that I wish I could correct you in your path.

Things like not to trust people so easily. To shun situations when you detect bullshit. To be able to discern a little better. To be a little more humble and to think a little further.

Regardless of what you will be going through, you will grow into a better person.
<h2>You have to choose to be better.</h2>
Like a wave that hits the beach again and again. Born and rebirth. Born and rebirth. You will hold many dreams, you will test the limit of many things. You will realise that you will embark on things that will be time waster. You will soon to see that not all dreams are worth pursuing.

There will be choices that might initially look valuable and strategic but are in reality, are distractions.

But it is okay, because you are young, still in your early 20s, without much to commit.

Then again, even here, in my late twenties, I am still carving out my legacy bit by bit. You will never know what the future brings unless you embark on it.
<h3>Go forth with your adventure.</h3>
However, if there is one thing that I will want you to change, is perhaps to stay focus. Regardless of what other say, keep your eye on your initial goal, that is to help others. Be careful not to fall into the allure of the glit and all that shimmers.

Life hold a mystery for you to discover.

And yes, you are a gem.

Thank you for your naivety. Thank you for your tenacious spirit.

This will be the story which we will write.
<h3>Because this is our destiny.</h3>]]></content:encoded>
