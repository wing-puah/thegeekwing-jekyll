## Rejection
"Wow, you speak very well. Which university did you come from?", the lady from a MNC asked.

"I graduated from polytechnic", I state matter-of-factly.

"Oh, if you were to send your resume over, it wouldn't even have made it". Is that disdain in her eyes?

8 years back, when I decide to [embark on the unconventional path](https://www.thegeekwing.com/technology/musings/2018/08/05/the-girl-called-wing/) of life, I never entirely know what life holds for me. Working holiday, [animal conservation educator](https://www.thegeekwing.com/technology/2018/05/29/from-zoo-to-technology/), fitness instructor and sports coaching. It has been almost a decade of freelancing and creating my own personal brand in the education/ coaching industry. To me, at that point of time in my life, being able to live the life of pursuing the dream and passion outweighs every practicality of life. To me, we only live once.

Facing a closure of a decade worth of work on empowerment, coaching and education, I structure my next venture to break into the technology industry.

"Aviation management and services", whenever someone asks me regarding my academic background.

It will soon be followed by, "I mean what do you really know when you are 16? You choose the coolest sounding course with the lowest cut-off points, right? That sort of thing."

**2017**: I start to [reevaluate my choices in life](https://www.thegeekwing.com/technology/musings/2018/08/17/the-lights-go-off/). Do I continue to hold on to my beliefs and almost obstinate way of doing things? Or do I succumb to the practicality of life? Well, programming seems like a great skill and viable livelihood to pick up.


**2018**: Because of my freelance work, I am hired into a technological startup. I start to share about my journey of being a self taught programmer. I start to record and share it on social media. Sometimes, it feels like three steps forward and two steps backwards. Co-chair of GCNS youth forum, co-organiser of condo wide Christmas event at Topiary, emcee at various events,
