## Wordpress
I have been using Wordpress hosted on Hostgator for at least 6 years now.

When I first started blogging, it is a quick and convenient tool for me to get my website up quickly. Want a new website? Sure, within 15 minutes and a few clicks, a wordpress website is up.

That is the time when I am not coding much.

**Heck, at that point of time, I think CSS and HTML is programming.**

Last year, I start to delve more into proper programming, front-end.

I learn about SSH, compile SASS, craft javascript syntax and enroll myself into FreeCodeCamp. Then, I learn about GitHub. It takes me at least a week to figure out what all this Git is about.

## Github
When I first start to use GitHub, I only think it sounds really cool and geeky. I didn't understand why is it so useful to developers. Like, isn't it just a cloud-based platform for people to store code?

**I am not impressed.**

And what is all this pull, fetch, push, merge about? Why did the GUI tells me that I can't push the changes to other people code? What exactly is happening? I mean, what is this push for?

Great, another source of confusion in my already complicated learning journey. I don't even get why the element of getElementById can have so many more different functions than getElementsByClassName.

**Completely lost and hopeless in this coding province.**   

## Keep hacking
A few days of pressing buttons, reading articles and testing all this different command on my Git Bash. I finally get it!

**Repository and version control.**

I crack the code.

GitHub is a repository for storing your coding files. And it offers version control, which means that if I screw up my code and I want to go back to a previous version of my file, I could just navigate around GitHub and retrieve it.

It's like a save in a game, in which, if you die, you can go back to your healthy state!

## Jekyll
I fall in love and attempt to push all my existing projects to GitHub. There isn't too many projects at the moment, so I break one website into a few smaller projects. For example, my [tabbed navigation with vanilla javascript](https://github.com/wing-puah/tab-navigation).

Just when I think I reach coding heaven, looking at my puny code on this developer hub, shareable and searchable, I found Jekyll.

You mean something can get more awesome than GitHub?

### Static site generator

Did I mention free hosting on GitHub pages?

Blogging like a hacker?

Writing post not through a user interface but on a text editor?

Moving away from the overkilled content management system to a version controlled site pure static HTML files?

**Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sign me up.**

I migrated my blog from Wordpress to Jekyll and I love the transition thus far. It gets me excited that I have complete control over my code.

_Yes, me. Control freak._

Jekyll has me addicted to blogging again. I love the way everything is structured with my own code. I love how sleek I could make my site look.

**Truly, Jekyll makes blogging a true state of art.**
