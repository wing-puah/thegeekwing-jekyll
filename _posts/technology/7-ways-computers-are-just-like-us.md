## The journey to human body
There are certain mechanisms of a computer that function similarly to our body. I'm not talking about bionics, although that could very well be a common sight in the near future. In the past 2 years, I have been poring through pages, understanding the human body, muscles functions, electrical synapses, chemical reaction and other bodily functions. It is a pursuit to uncover ways to optimise our bodies and capabilities. I study yoga, sports science and also some other ethereal mind-body connection concepts.

## The journey to technology
Now, moving on to a technological industry and learning the technological concepts, I see many parallelism between the two seemingly disconnected components. For one, when I am freelancing and have to explain the concept of hosting, multiple domains, databases and things that make websites work, I gravitate naturally to using the examples of human, rooms and house to illustrate the different components.  

## The cross path
**Here are 5 ways computers are just like our human body.**

### 5.Memory
Just like human, computer and electronic devices have memory. Human brain has 3 main types of memory: sensory, short term and long term. Our memory helps us to process information. And according to the psychology, we process this information via encoding, storage and retrieval. Sounds familiar?

### 4.Electricity
It is a no-brainer that computer runs on electricity. But do you know that everything we do is controlled and facilitated by electrical signals too? When your nervous system send signals or when the synapses are firing, it actually means electricity. Going back to secondary science, electricity is caused by movement of electrons. And electrons are part of atoms. What does atom makes up? Everything.

### 3.Mathematics
In optimising athlete's performance, there is a discipline known as biomechanics. As the name implies, biomechanics is the study of mechanical law pertaining to the movement or structure of living organisms. In biomechanics, there are all sort of numbers and formulas thrown around. In computer optimisation, this seems to revolves around mathematical modeling as well.  

### 2.Load
For our human body to perform, it is an intricate balancing between loading and unloading. There are different techniques employ to progressive load, periodization cycle to make sure the human body peak performance coincides with competition day. In order to achieve that, there is a lot of modeling and planning involve. In terms of computer, CPU load also needs to be managed so that the performance of the computer is optimal.

### 1.Feedback loop
Feedback loop occurs in various forms in the human body. A feedback loop is a biological occurrence wherein the output of a system amplifies the system (positive feedback) or inhibits the system (negative feedback). Feedback loops are important because they allow living organisms to maintain homeostasis. A feedback loop is used commonly in designing system as well. The system takes the system output into consideration. This loop enables the system to adjust its performance to meet a desired output either via positive feedback or negative feedback.
