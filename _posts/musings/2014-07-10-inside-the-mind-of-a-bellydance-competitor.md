"And the next contestant, number twenty two, Puah Hui Ying."

I have to forget the pain in my knees. I never have that pain before, it happens only when I'm standing on the steps at the side of the stage. I could feel my heartbeat, faster than the drums beat playing through the sound system. The cliches of life all living in my cells right now. But I have to do it, I'm already here. A nod to the DJ and my song plays at the atrium of Far East Plaza.

## Belly dance competition
_Focus. Wait for the beat. Smile, shoulder shimmy, strut in to the middle of the stage._

The tips of my lips freezes perpetually upwards. Or rather, as my friend would point it out, the most fake smile he has seen from me. During the dance, sometimes I got off-beats. But the same smile remains. At some point, I am sprinting across the beats, dancing to compete to the finishing line with the music. But the music is not interested in competing in my silly race.

As the music goes, I slip somewhere in between the consciousness of enjoying myself and feeling nervous. Apparently, this effect goes into my wrists, as they flip around like it's broken, forming a chicken wing like shape. I am aware of my movements but I lose sense of some parts of my body.

## Only now
This is the moment when I am not one, I become more than one. I am the dancer who is competing with the beats. I am the dancer who looks drunk. I am the dancer who is enjoying herself. I am the dancer who dances not to compete with others but to enjoy herself.

**1 minute 40 second**
The music is inside of me. I make up the steps towards the end of the show.

_Shimmy, step, step, spin, shimmy._

**2 minute 58 second**
I end my dance two second before the song ends. I hold my pose awkwardly as the audience hesitate to clap. 3 minute, the song end.

## Applause
I finish my piece, or my song finish me, I cannot really tell the difference. Gawkiness takes over, I forget to bow and speed down the stage. This is how my first solo performance end.

But my journey of dance is just beginning. Now, I know clearly that I love dance. I love to perform dance. I want to spread the positive vibes and joys of dance. I want people to feel the connection around them, the connection of simplicity, gratitude and passion.

Things will only get better from now on. I will dance on, bringing arts to life.
