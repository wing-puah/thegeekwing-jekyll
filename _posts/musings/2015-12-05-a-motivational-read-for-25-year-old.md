## Life
Encounters of cheats and scam artists. Failures, disappointments and scorn. Because of those, you might have grown a little skeptical.

**Your world of dreams might have shrunk a little.**

You know there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It hurts more when you learn that the end of the rainbow is nothing but an optical illusion.

## Intersection
Adventures, love and dreams. And hopefully more tales to come. You are at the peak of your young adulthood. 4 years ago, you officially become an adult, you become legal in the eyes of justice. 5 more years, you are going into your big 3.

**Maybe the world isn’t so hostile after all.**

You manage to meet helpful strangers, who become friends. If you are fortunate enough, you might too have found your soul mate.

Do you still remember how it is like for you 10 years back? When you are still a teen? When you look to the adults and think to yourself how they seem to have it all. No homework, no exams, no deadlines. Glitz and glam. Holidays and cruise. Photos to show it all off. And money to spend on things that they like.

## Questions
How is it like for you now? Back to your reality. Now, you are at where they are, 25. Maybe you still do not have your life together. But you get a glimpse to the social issues: economic crisis, inequality, prejudices and political unrest. You remember saying that you are going to change the world and make the world a better place. You are younger then and you hold wild ambitions.

Perhaps now, at the age of 25, you still do not have any clear directions on how to achieve that. But you know better.

**You know that not knowing could be more of the norm.**

By 25, you meet mentors and people of different age group and you realise it is common for people to not have a clue on what is going on with their lives.

But it’s okay, you're only 25. Your commitments are rising but hopefully you're out of debt. Maybe you've been bumming around for the past 25 years. However, you can still make the choice to pick things up over the next 25 years.

You need to make the decision now. You don’t have time to waste.

## Now
You only have this moment.

If you have yet to do so, now is the time to live so hard that you don’t look back in regrets. Wake up everyday and choose to hustle. You might not know exactly what your purpose in life is yet. But just keep working on it, grab opportunities as they come.

**You never know when you will chance upon your calling, so don’t avoid the toil.**

Your purpose won’t fall from the sky if all you do is to talk about it. Go far and go broad in search of it. When you find it, stay on it with laser-like focus. Sometimes it is not about following your heart, it is about recognizing the potential in the path.

There are possibilities and opportunities to explore. You might end up on the wrong side of the path but allow these experiences to make you stronger and kinder.

Do good, create, try new things, be open to love, reflect at the end of the day and talk to strangers. Experiment with a new recipe, watch a documentary, fall asleep under the stars and volunteer for a cause.

You are 25. Some people never live to that age.

It is great just to be alive.

## Today
A great time to create your life.

Now, do that every single day.
