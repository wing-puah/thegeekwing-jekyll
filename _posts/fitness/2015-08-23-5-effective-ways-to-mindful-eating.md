Do you struggle with food too? I have.

With so much food around us, I know how difficult it can be to make a choice.

I was a binger, a comfort eater and a nibbler at various parts of my life. And I work in an organic cafe where I’m constantly surrounded with food. **Growing up, I ate four big meals. And I stop only when I feel bloated**.

But since I was growing, my weight did not fluctuate out of control. While that might be a good thing, but I never learn to listen to my body. And the usual bad habits: skipping my meals, having long time gap between meals, munching constantly and wolfing down food. Been there, done that.

We are living in an era where we have no lack of food. More than that, we are bombarded with choices that are calories dense, high in sugar, high in fats, high in salt and contain trans fat. We are facing an epidemic of obesity, and a rise in rich men disease: high blood pressure, heart attack and diabetes.

## Mindful eating
It’s true that we are what we eat and how we eat.

We can choose to suffer from the consequences of our poor choice of diet or flourish with our healthy eating habits.

**Being mindful of that is our first key to change.**

Just a few months ago, I start to look at my own physique. I am exercising frequently and eating healthily, but my body fats remain. My BMI is in the healthy range and I don’t look fat. But I have a belly. It is only after reading up on fat loss that make me become more mindful about my eating habits.

Outwardly, I have a very healthy relationship with food: vegetarianism, little junk food, little sugar, organic produce. But I’m overeating due to the fact that I’m eating too quickly. For me, the change can be implemented quickly. Within 29 days, I’m seeing results from my mindful eating.

Today, I’m going to share my 5 tips with you.

## 5. Tune into your body before eating
_“Why do I eat?”_
Taking a pause before I reach out to my favorite cashew nuts (and the next, and the next, before I know it I must have consumed 500 calories worth of nuts) helps me to tune into my body. Do I eat because I’m bored? Or does my body really need the nourishment?

Sometimes when we feel hunger, we are actually dehydrated. Our brain can get confused over these two. So hydrate yourself if you are feeling hungry. If you feel satisfied after drinking, chances are you are just thirsty.

If after drinking and you still feel hungry but it is not your meal time yet, **take small servings on your plate so that you could keep tuning into your body after each bite.**

I know I can’t resist the bottle of cashew nuts right in front of me. So I will pick up five to six nuts and slowly savour them in the living room.

## 2. Don’t allow yourself to starve
The previous point addresses the issue of overeating. This point emphasizes on not depriving your body. **When we become too hungry, we tend to gorge down our food.** This creates a tendency of overeating. Our brain and body register fullness in about 20 to 30 minutes. If we are finishing our meal before that period of time, there might be a chance that we will overeat.

## 3. Savour each bite
If you are like me, a fast eater, you tend to find yourself finishing your meal under 20 minutes. Becoming more mindful of each chew will help.

Avoid eating with TV, smartphones, computer or anything that could steal your focus away from your food. People are of course excluded. We tend to chat when dining in social environment, and thus spending a longer time on our meal. However, be aware, being in a social situation might result in us overeating.

**Try this practice: take a bite, put down the utensils and become mindful of the food in your mouth.**

Can you taste the nuances of the flavours? Does it melt? Does it leave an aromatic aftertaste? If you chew longer, you could enjoy the sensory delight for a longer time. Chew well. Chew until your food is liquefied or lost its texture.

## 4. Plan your meals
Planning your meal doesn’t mean tedious calories calculation for each meal. **It could just be something as simple as making the resolution to eat clean and at regulated timing.** If you prepare your own meal at home, you won’t need to wrestle your willpower to over salad or pizza.

You automate your choice of food and remove a lot of distractions.

Have you ever experience spending an hour in social media only to feel guilty of how much time you have wasted not spending clearing your mountain of work? This could be due to a lack of plan. If you have plan your day on 90 minutes work and 15 minutes rest block, you find yourself sticking to the plan much better.

Similarly, for your meals, once you have a plan, it will become easier to stick to healthy eating.

## 5. Make use of tools
In order to ensure you have a smooth transition to mindful and healthy eating, make use of all the available tools in the beginning. Use your non-dominate hand to eat to slow down your pace. Use chopstick instead of fork and spoon.
