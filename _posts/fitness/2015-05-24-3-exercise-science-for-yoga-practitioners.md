Yoga can be spiritual, physical and/or mental exercise for the practitioners. Some practitioners do mostly pranayama. Some like hand balances and strong posture. Some do raja yoga, the yoga of meditation.

The beauty of yoga is that there is a variety of practices that appeals to people of different personalities and needs.

But generally, most people know yoga as a physical practice. The practice of _asanas_, the physical postures, is a form of physical exercise. Even though yoga is considered to be of low impact, you still can get hurt (read: **sports injuries**) if you don’t practice it with the right knowledge and mindfulness.

## Enter exercise science
Having said that, yoga is a great movement-based activity to engage it. It helps one to focus, reduce stress, build strength and many more. We could gain more benefits from yoga if we educate ourselves on these 3 exercise science.  

Prevent injuries and optimize the practice.
## 3. Stretching is not a warm up
In my younger days, warming up means static stretching, the kind that you hold the stretch for seconds. But science has proven that [static stretching as a warm up decreases muscular strength and power](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/777155).

A warm up should preferably be a dynamic activity that gradually increases the body internal temperature and prepares the body for more rigorous demands of the session. It should be a combination of light aerobic exercises and active stretches.

**Don’t stretch a cold muscle.**

Yoga classes should never start with static stretches. When you do static stretches before exercising, your body may think it's at risk of being overstretched. It compensates by contracting and becoming more tense. That means you aren't able to move as fast or as freely, making you more likely to get hurt.

## 2. Stretch properly
Yoga is not only about stretching, but since it is what comes into people mind when they first think about stretching, we will continue to talk a little more about the science of stretching. Never do a ballistic stretch, that is bouncing while you stretch. By attempting to use the momentum to stretch further, you are not allowing your muscles to adjust to the stretch and can cause injuries. Also, ballistic stretching activates the [stretch reflex](http://people.bath.ac.uk/masrjb/Stretch/stretching_2.html#SEC15), causing the muscles to contract, thus defeating the purpose of stretching.

To stretch correctly, move to a point where you feel tension in your muscles without discomfort, avoid pain and hold the stretch for 15 to 60 seconds with two to four repetitions.

## 3. Some postures can be a little too extreme to your hips
Don’t we just adore the picture of yogis in the extreme backbends and extreme forward bends? Don’t we just wish that we are as bendy as them? It seems to me that images that inspired people to practice yoga are people with flexibilities that can qualify them into cirque du soleil. Unless we are really part of the entertainment company, there is no valid reason for most of us to work towards some extreme postures.

Working in such extreme postures could cause damage to our hips joints. Our hips are ball and socket joint and this kind of joint allows a large range of motion. When we move jam our thigh bone into our hips: forward bending, splits, putting our legs behind our head, it will create friction in the hips joint. If we happen to have [femoroacetabular impingement](http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00571) (FAI) forms, the femoral head will rub abnormally against the acetabulum, creating addition friction, which will potentially create damage to the hip joint. FAI can cause pain in the hips area and it is also associated with cartilage damage, labral tears, early hip arthritis, sports hernias, and low back pain.

Respect the limits of your body, stay away from pain and drop your ego and competitiveness in a yoga practice.
