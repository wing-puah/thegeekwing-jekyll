In yoga, there is a saying, “You are Only as Young as your Spine is Flexible”. Yoga benefits include reducing stress, increasing positive emotions and improving our physical body. However, we are also seeing yoga injuries on the rise as yoga has became increasingly athletic.

It is not only until I embark on my journey to become a certified fitness instructor that I realize that there is a huge
gap in my knowledge of the human body.

Although yoga goes beyond the physical, most practitioners adopt a strong physical practice. So a lack of human anatomy and kinesiology in the yoga teachercould potentially cause injuries to practitioners. We can actually find [personal yoga anecdotes](http://loveyogaanatomy.com/what-are-we-actually-doing-in-asana-introducing-the-wawadia-project/) at the What Are We Actually Doing in Asana? Project by Matthew Remski.

Before, we go into the 5 facts, let’s understand the structure of our spine. Our spine is made up of 4 sections: **cervical spine (neck)**, **thoracic spine (upper back)**, **lumbar spine (lower back)** and **sacral curve (tail bone)**.

The spine serves as a pillar of support to our body and to protect our spinal cord. Our spines have curves as this structure enables our spines to withstand heavy stress.

Today, we will look into 5 facts about our spine to create a safe environment for our yoga practices.

## 5. Our cervical spine is the weakest part of the entire spine
Let’s start from the top, our cervical spine.

Everyday, our cervical spine has to support our head, which is about 4.5 to 5 kg. Nowadays, due to modern day lifestyle, we are already putting a lot of stress on our cervical spine. A head forward-tilt position adds pressure to our cervical spine.

<blockquote>
A 15 degrees put 12 kg and 60 degrees tilt put 27kg of stress on the cervical spine¹.
<br/>
Every inch of forward head posture is putting at least 3 kg of stress on the cervical spine².
</blockquote>

Over time, this amount of daily stress put into our cervical spine might cause a loss of the natural curve, wear, tear, early degeneration and weakness.

### Application to yoga
In yoga, the headstand and shoulder stand has been touted as the king and queen of yoga practice. In additional, there is the plough pose.

When we go into these postures, we are placing tremendous stress on our cervical spine, which has been most probably weakened by modern day living. There are both benefits and risks to inversions. We should only attempt these postures after careful evaluation of the strength of the cervical spine and the risks-benefits involve.

When going into the postures, care must be taken to transfer the weight of the body away from the cervical spine.

In **headstand**, we have to learn to use our shoulders and arms to support our weight.

In **shoulder stand**, we can increase the surface area of the back in contact with the floor or use a blanket to reduce the flexion of the neck.

I will skip the **plough** because I don’t think they are worth it. But the decision is yours to make.


## 4. Our thoracic spine should be mobile
Thoracic mobility is essential for maintaining a good posture in our daily living. A stiff thoracic spine can be inferred from an increased in the rounding of upper back, a forward head posture and possibly an increase in the lower back curve. Again, our modern day lifestyle of constant sitting can lead to this negative change.

A stiff thoracic restrict the ribs joint, which in turn restrict breathing. Our bodies never work in isolation, when one region is out of balance, it will affect the other region. In the case of stiffness of the thoracic spine, the lumbar spine will come into the picture to take the role of the thoracic spine.

In other words, the thoracic spine has failed to do what it is supposed to do. So, the lumbar spine has to take on the function that it is not design to be doing in order to compensate for this failure. In such event, the lumbar spine will become overwork, possibly resulting in lower back pain.

### Application to yoga
Yoga is about connecting the body and the mind through the breath. So an inability to breathe deeply will reduce the calming benefits of yoga practice. There are a lot of twisting postures in yoga. In order to gain an optimal functionality of our body in the practice, we should feel the rotation more in our thoracic spine than the lumbar spine.

When we complain about lower back pain or neck, the source of pain might be coming from the thoracic spine. Rather than doing more neck or lower back exercises, we should spend some time considering the kinetic link and look into our thoracic spine.

We have to get to the root of the problem in order to implement a long term solution. However, do note that it is outside the scope of yoga to diagnose the cause of problems and we should be looking for accredited professionals if required.

Next week, we will cover [3 more facts](/fitness/2015/06/07/5-spine-facts-for-yoga-practitioners-2/) about the spine for a more well-informed yoga practice.
